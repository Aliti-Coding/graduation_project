Less than 2 weeks later they drop the price by $20,000!!! Tesla gave no warning of this and when I finally got someone to communicate with me they refuse to provide me any compensation for the 20% loss in value. They have also degraded the features I thought I would get such as proximity warnings, a feature I had on my older much less expensive previous car. They say Tesla Vision is coming but so far it is vaporware just like their Full Self Driving (FSD) they have been selling and promising for years.\",\n",

It infuriates us to know that we just bought our tesla in November and you decide to give a big discount and as well as free super charging to customers . I feel you should at least reconsider Reimbursing\\nCustomers like my wife and I or at least offer something to compensate the loss we will be facing in the event we trade in our Y model in at a later date . We don’t even get a tax credit to help us in this tuff time we are all facing . I look forward to hearing from you and your response.\\n\\nSent from my iPad',\n",
