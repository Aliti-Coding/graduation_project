Each rescue took several hours, with much of the time spent under water.\\n  \\n\\n      The most dangerous part was the first kilometer, during which the divers and boys were required to squeeze through a narrow, flooded channel.\\n  \\n\\n      Rescuers needed to hold the boys’ oxygen tanks in front of them and swim pencil-like through submerged holes. Having completed this section, the boys were then handed over to separate, specialist rescue teams, who helped assist them through the remainder of the cave, much of which they could wade through.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHIANG RAI, THAILAND - July 10: Onlookers at the junction in front of Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital watch and cheer as ambulances transport the last rescued schoolboys and their coach from a helipad nearby to Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital on July 10, 2018 in Chiang Rai, Thailand. Divers began an effort to pull the 12 boys and their soccer coach on Sunday morning after they were found alive in the cave at northern Thailand. Thai Navy SEALs confirmed on Tuesday that the 12 boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach have now all been extracted safely after they were found alive in the cave at northern Thailand. The boys of the Wild Boars soccer team and their coach are to spend at least a week in a hospital in Chiang Rai Province due to a risk of rare infections.(Photo by Linh Pham/Getty Images)\\n\\nLinh Pham/Getty Images\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Thai cave rescue ended in success. Here's the full story\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Phromthep, known as Dom, left the cave as part of the second group of boys carried out on more than two weeks after they were first trapped. He was one of three boys whose birthdays slipped by while they were deep underground. In his first message to his parents he implored them not to forget. “I’m fine, but the weather is quite cold. But don’t worry,” he said. “Don’t forget my birthday,” he said.\\n  \\n\\n      From hospital, after his rescue, he said he wanted pork and rice to eat and thanked everyone for all their support.\\n  \\n\\n      All 12 of the rescued boys and their coach were then transported to a nearby hospital for recuperation.\\n  \\n\\n      Family members greeted the news of their rescue with relief and tears of happiness, punching the air when they heard that their boys were alive.\\n  \\n\\n      Reacting to Phromthep’s death, Prajak Sutham, one of the Thai cave survivors, wrote on Facebook: “We have been through together a lot, good and bad times. We had went through life and death situations together, when you told me to wait and see the time you became a national player. I always believed that you could do it. Last time we met before you left to UK, I jokingly told you that, when you’re back I would ask for your signature. Rest in Peace Bro, we always have each other, the 13 of us.”\\n  \\n\\n      The Doi Wao temple in his hometown in Chiang Rai also expressed their condolences to Phromthep’s mother.\\n  \\n\\n      Brooke House College, the school which Phromthep attended as a Football Academy student, said in a statement that his death “has left our college community deeply saddened and shaken.”\\n  \\n\\n      “This event has left our college community deeply saddened and shaken. We unite in grief with all of Dom’s family, friends, former teammates and those involved in all parts of his life, as well as everyone affected in any way by this loss in Thailand and throughout the college’s global family,” the college’s principal, Ian Smith, said.\\n  \\n\\n      According to the statement, Brooke House College is liaising with statutory authorities and the Royal Thai Embassy in London, and “dedicating all resources to assist our student body, as they as young people process Dom’s passing.”\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
