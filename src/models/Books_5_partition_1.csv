0,5,"the king, the mice and the cheese by nancy gurney is an excellent children's book.  it is one that i well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it.

it is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese. he consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice. the cats become a nuisance, so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away.  the cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants, brought in to chase away the lions that'd chased away the dogs.

the story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king.  the story also teaches cause and effect relationships.

the pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable.  i was thrilled to discover that it is back in print.  i *highly* recommend it for children ages 2 to 7.",a story children will love and learn from,1112140800,A1REUF3A1YCPHM,TW Ervin II
12,3,"41 years later:

the cheese is government cheese.

the mice objected to the king's idea of good manners as species-centric, and rebelled.

the king blamed the peasants, and forbade them to keep cats or chase mice from their homes.

this made things worse. peasants that could afford to do so moved as far away from mice as possible.

74,3,"the carpet wars is a sampler of informal writing from australian journalist (and avid carpet collector) christopher kremmer over ten years in central asia.  since most of it was written, and concerns events, before 9/11, when the area was not established in the west's cultural radar as it is today, it gives a view of the region that is uncluttered by hindsight reevaluations.
kremmer writes of his time in afghanistan, pakistan, tajikstan, kashmir, and iran, giving us colorful and non-journalistic slices of life from each region.  he enlivens his writings with vivid character studies of those he met on his travels, from dignitaries like ill-fated afghan dictator mohammed najibullah and legendary guerilla ahmad shah massoud to various carpet dealers kremmer got to know over his time in the region.  between these character sketches and kremmer's anecdotes, he delivers measured doses of regional history and politics, and he imparts a surprising amount of information about his favorite hobby, the asian carpet.
the result is more than just some very entertaining travel writing.  kremmer's lively and discursive work also functions as an excellent introduction to the central asian economy and politics.  besides being for those who just like to read about travel in interesting foreign parts, the carpet wars will also be useful for non-scholars who want to have some idea how movements like the taliban came to be, but want to take a spoonful of sugar with this medicine.
(kremmer's book also taught me that i'll never know enough to bargain effectively for an asian carpet -- but his rueful and wry work also admits that there is a certain pleasure in being cheated.)",painless education,1089244800,A1JS302JFHH9DJ,Daniel H. Bigelow
79,3,"i love this series, but this entry is not hillerman's best stuff.  i'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of joe leaphorn and jim chee don't allow much development at this point.  the dense subplotting and evocative details about navajo life, so evident in the best leaphorn/chee stories, are mostly missing here.  hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the jim chee/bernie manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way.  if you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of hillerman's considerable talent; the dark wind is probably the best of the best.","ok, but far from hillerman's best",1052697600,A2VDN6OJOIY74W,B.

89,3,"not everything i read is an arc ... i'm a pretty dedicated library user as well.

i've long been a fan of the american southwest.  it is one of my favorite places to visit and vacation.  i've also been aware that tony hillerman - a name that any bibliophile should recognize - writes mysteries set in the american southwest.  so why haven't i read his works before this? mostly i think it's because i've only recently developed an affection for the mystery/thriller genre.

although sixteenth in a series, i don't get the impression that reading the previous fifteen books in a necessity to enjoy this.  the reader is likely to understand some of the character relationships that have developed over the course of the series, but the story itself seems to be contained within the covers.

bernadette ""bernie"" manuelito once worked for the tribal police but now is a border patrol/customs officer.  she quickly develops a reputation for herself and while helping out some stranded border-crossers, she is told that a photo of her has been circulating around mexico, identifying her as potentially dangerous and someone the criminals might want to be rid of. she becomes a target when she visits an exotic game ranch which was once a station for a gas pipeline.  unknown to bernie, but figuring it out when he learns she's become a target, is sergeant jim chee, who is madly in love with bernie.  the old pipe lines might be in use to smuggle something in to the country. but knowing what is being smuggled and who is the force (and money) behind the operation, is something that brings even more danger to bernie, chee, and joe leaphorn.

i found this to be pretty standard (and average) mystery/thriller fare. the bad guys were appropriately bad, but they also seemed sort of 'bond' bad - stereotyped bad guys.  wealthy, white, powerful, connected.

i found the set-up really interesting and the regular characters pretty believable and worth following for a couple more books at least, but i was disappointed in the 'resolution' of the story.  i'm not real fond of the deus ex machina  ending or the dumb luck/getting out of a jam because of something or someone completely outside of the protagonists control.

as i say, this was pretty average.  it often felt very dated, not just but how characters were acting, but how they were being portrayed.  i'll read a few more and see how i feel about the series.

91,3,"the plot and action are fine. tony hillerman certainly can tell a story, and although this one is only on navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book, hillerman does an excellent job of re-setting the scene in southernmost new mexico as officer bernie manueliti leaves the tribal police for a new job with the us border patrol. cowboy dashie and joe leaphorn play their usual solid key roles, a rogue pilot/political henchman adds a great deal to the plot, an evil villain gets what he deserves, but the steady and taciturn jim chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot, especially when facing his feelings for manuelito. all the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely, the title fits nicely, but unfortunately there is very little authentic navajo lore to add to the atmosphere. that is usually a highlight in a hillerman novel, and i missed that. i still would have given the book 4 stars, if it weren't for the really weak ""romance"" between chee and manuelito. it never felt real or genuine, and its lame, sobbing 1950s-style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair. all mystery lovers and tony hillerman fans expect better from such a skilled author.","3.5 stars - decent plot, horrible ""romance,"" not enough navajo lore",1492214400,A3VTEB4N3JVPYF,retiredandlovinit

 this is a solid novel, perhaps a little better than some other hillerman novels i have read.  the plot is logical, the writing professional.  the downfall is that nothing really stands out about this novel.  its not the sort of novel that youll remember long after you read it.  its descent enough to pass the time and is a solid read, but not particularly memorable.

the plot here is also weaker than others. the story rests on a device that i have seen elsewhere, in both film and novels, including a variant in one of the older james bond movies. its not that mysterious, and unfortunately i did not find the denouement at all credible.

185,3,"if you're thinking of buying the sinister pig to get your joe leaphorn and jim chee fix, you might want to look for another hillerman novel.  this book centers on chee's new love, officer bernadette manuelito, once a member of the navajo police force.  as the book opens, bernie, as she's called, has transferred to the border patrol.  she's miserable because she misses chee, but he had never told her how he felt about her, so she left . . .  well, it's an old story.

meanwhile, chee is agonizing about her being gone, but doesn't want to pick up the phone and call her or go to see her because she might tell him to get lost or . . .  yeah, an old story.

with this kind of start, a reader might think it's going to be the old saw about the man rescuing his lovely girlfriend, realizing how much he loves her, and they live happily ever after.  well, not quite.

getting to the end of this tale, however, is far from a straight line as hillerman concentrates on one plot point, then another, then another.  it would seem that he heard about how the ""pig"" is used to clean pipelines and decided it would make a good story.  it certainly is the centerpiece of this story.  oh, that and a hit man who . . .  mustn't give that away either.

for all its seeming shortcomings, the sinister pig provides bits of leaphorn and chee for diehard hillerman fans to enjoy and descriptions of new mexico to ponder.  it's short and a quick read, more a novella really, while not fully satisfying, not terribly disappointing either.",and the hero is . . .,1317686400,A39QEKNEFSJ34Q,hrladyship

188,3,"the setup
an apparently retired cia agent (gordon stein, aka david slate) is hired by a u.s. senator to investigate how a natural gas pipeline system has been used to cheat native americans in the southwest of $4 billion annually in royalties.  he is murdered on navajo land in the extreme northwestern corner of new mexico.  navajo tribal policeman (sargent) jim chee is assigned to assist the fbi in the investigation.  in the meantime bernadette manualetto has resigned from the tribal police, because she is annoyed with chee for not pursuing her, and has joined (implausibly) the border patrol, and thus is stationed in the extreme southwestern corner of new mexico, along the mexican border.  she observes some odd ""goings-on"" on the large private tuttle ranch on the border.  that's the setup.

comments
earlier novels in the series were very ""economical"", with a few well developed characters, and straightforward filler-free stories.  with the previous novel, ""wailing wind"", and even more-so with the ""sinister pig"". hillerman is (unfortunately?) entering the mainstream of police mystery novels, with dozens of named characters, most throw-away (i.e., that appear on one or two pages, never to be heard from or of again, with no particular significance to the novel); and complex plots.  the stories are no longer about native americans, but rather are about ""white people"" who coincidentally interact somehow with jim chee, et al.  the fascinating expositions on native religion and philosophy is over, except for thin references.  fortunately, hillerman is sufficiently talented to keep up with mainstream mystery writers.  but i, for one, miss the earlier character-centric and native-centric novels.

caveats
the novel is unnecessarily confused by two premises:  1) the first is that pipelines were being used in the rip-off of native american royalties.  that simply makes no sense---the routing of petroleum in pipelines is irrelevant, just as irrelevant as the highways a petroleum tanker truck drives on.  it is in the accounting that any rip-offs of native american royalties could have taken place.  2) the second premise is a cocaine importation scheme.  it looks like these two storylines were intended to converge, but don't.

other evidence of rushed, poorly-edited writing, are redundancies, such as the multiply repeated explaination of the functioning of pipeline pigs.

readers are teased with the promise of a delicious expose of political corruption, then perhaps a scheme by al queda to smuggle nuclear weapons into the u.s., but are finally left with a few sleazy druggies.  certainly, when you start turning over rocks, the slimy creatures you find are not necessarily the ones you were looking for, but, in the final analysis there was no adequate reason for the murder of slate/stein.

moreover, unless i misread the book, the illegal-alien family which bernie rescued had immigrated on rumors that a copper smelter on the u.s. side of the border would be reopened.  (the fictional smelter closely corresponds to the hildalgo smelter, which was closed in 1999.  ironically the company town of playas was purchased by the u.s. government for an anti-terrorism training center).  then the closed smelter is described as being located in mexico, and is the origin from which ""pigs"" are transported to the tuttle ranch on the u.s. side of the border.  huh?

the verdict
a good read in a great series, but unnecessarily confusing.

190,3,"among the various detective novelists writing today, tony hillerman occupies a pretty unique position. his series of detective novels, following first the adventures of two different characters, lt. joe leaphorn and sgt. jim chee, in separate books. later, hillerman combined the two characters, and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now. he's added supporting characters, including a series of girlfriends for chee, a wife who died and then a lady friend for leaphorn, and colleagues like the inimitable cowboy dashee, who's appeared in the background of several of the books.

this latest entry in the series isn't the strongest, but it is interesting. someone's been killed on the reservation, and before anyone can investigate, the fbi shows up and closes down the investigation, announcing the improbably verdict of ""hunting accident"". chee doesn't buy the explanation, and both he and leaphorn take to investigating on their own. meanwhile, a former colleague of theirs, bernadette manuelito, has gone to work for the border patrol. while there, she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the reservation that chee and leaphorn are running.

he is a very safe villain.  everybody can hate him.  he's a politically correct villain.  some rich pig who is greedy as can be, and murderous.  what's not to hate?

this was my first hillerman story, so i was not at all familiar with any of the characters.  there isn't one character in this story that i feel compelled to read more about.  i'm not rushing to find another hillerman story.

i didn't read the book.  i listened to the audio book while at work.  i'm always appreciative of someone reading a story to me while i'm stuck at work.  i can't sit behind my desk and read.

the opening of the book is a shocker.  we are introduced to a nearly retired cia agent.  he is, apparently, the star of the book.  but no, he's not.  boom, he's gone.

the rest of the story has to play out without the main character.  it is one of the oddest structured books i've ever come across.  the first character, the one who dominated the first chapter, is gone.  bye.  see ya.  now on to someone else.

and there is no star after him.  there is a handful of co-stars.  i'm not used to that.  this is very unique in that regard.  normally, a story has a star.  this one doesn't.

one drawback with being read to is that we are dependent on the person reading, and we have to listen to him do all the characters.  i don't understand why they don't have a group of people reading, each taking one character.  i'm tired of hearing the guy say ""he said"" over and over.  i'm even more tired of hearing a male voice portray a female character by changing to a really horrible imitation of a female voice.  couldn't they hire a woman to read with him?  we hear the guy talk in a higher voice.  it is very poorly done.  what else is he going to do?  he can't make himself sound anything like a woman.

there is only one interesting character in this story.  he is an employee of the sinister pig.  it falls to him to execute innocent girls.  the story progresses in the most expected way.  i could have written parts of the story line.  it is so obvious.  is this good guy actually going to murder the girls?  somehow i doubt it.  are the good guys going to win in the end?  yeah, i kind of think they will.

220,3,"once again tony lays out another vivid picture of new mexico's enchanting lanscape. but this time the setting is the mysterious and lonely desert area of nm's boot heel.

the characters are there. for the most part it reads like a typical hillerman leaphorn/chee book but with an exception. the story is hurried along after a few chapters. it's like someone was bored and wanted to get the manuscript to the publishers quick and be done with it. all true hillerman fans will read this book but i believe most will feel a bit cheated. it's a very short read even for a hillerman.

the beginning starts out with a perplexing and strange murder to solve but everything is unraveled quickly. i pretty much knew what to expect next from each character. the perfect chance to build suspense and a deep mystery was wasted by letting joe leaphorn solve everything way too quickly. it seems joe only needs a few phone calls and a simple map to solve anything. the usually savy chee and his intellegent cohort gal, now with another agency, are like bafoons relying mostly on the aging legendary leaphorn to figure everything out.

if you're a diehard leaphorn/chee fan like i am, you'll buy the book, even with its dissapointing 'not up to par' story.

if it's your first one in the series, do yourself a huge favor. read the first 15 before taking this one on. otherwise you'll miss out on how good hillerman can really be and might never bother to read the others.","still  love hillerman's charcters & land in spite of ""pig""",1092355200,A3NHI94FA6ME71,D.

229,2,"for years, tony hillerman has been giving us wonderful plots, intricate characters and breathtaking verbal landscapes. with ""the sinister pig,"" unfortunately, it seems mr. hillerman is growing tired of his leaphorn/chee series.
  the plot of ""the sinister pig,"" his latest in the series, is promising, but hillerman seems to have lacked either the energy or the desire to flesh it out into what could have been a fantastic novel. instead, what we get is a partially realized concept that clocks in at an anemic 240 pages. (and it's 240 heavily padded pages, at that, with blank pages between chapters, large type and heavy leading on the part of the typesetter. let's face it: this is more a novella masquerading as a novel than the real thing.)
  the book is also rife with proofing errors, including more missing question marks than one can count and at least one instance in which he accidentally refers to chee as leaphorn in mid-scene. that, plus a far-from-satisfying closing, makes ""the sinister pig"" feel like a rush job, as if hillerman was more interesting in finishing this project quickly than crafting a quality piece.

230,3,"over the many novels in hillerman's illustrious career, the readers have come to love the adventures of joe leaphorn and jim chee, however, the sinister pig seems to delve off onto a parallel tangent of the mysteries we've read for so long.
while both characters are present, it seems as if hillerman wanted to introduce something else besides yet another murder mystery, that is a little political commentary of his own.  the novel starts with a preface regarding missing royalties to the indian nations as it ties into oil profits and the u.s. government.  while i don't dispute his claims one way or another, sinister pig clearly is a vehicle for hillerman to present his personal viewpoints in a fictional manner and to make the reader really aware of this.
the story itself, while good, is missing the magical sense of navajo country and traditions the readers have come to expect from hillerman.  gone are the beautiful descriptions of the four corners area, and the deep culture of the native americans.  instead we find jim chee at a mid life crisis, contemplating his life as a bachelor and his love for former officer bernie manuelito.
joe leaphorn is present as well, but his character steps down as a main player to that of the supporting cast.  and while leaphorn has his momentous 'breakthrough' in the case, his involvement otherwise is minimal.
however, who does step up to the plate is bernie manuelito.  now as a border patrol officer assigned to lower new mexico, she stumbles across a corrupt department, and some 'fishy' on-goings at the nearby tuttle ranch.  something in regards to drugs, gas and oil pipelines, illegal immigration, the apparent murders of undercover government officials and of course and errant and deviant u.s. government.
the novel is pretty fast paced and is a very quick read.  chapters are small and to the point.  it was a good diversion for a hillerman book, but i hope this was just a half way point to a much larger novel that will bring our characters back to the forefront of native american culture and its roots in northern new mexico.",hillerman strays from known territory,1064275200,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,Jayson Olson

240,3,"as a longtime fan of tony hillerman's mystery series involving navajo policemen joe leaphorn, jim chee, and now bernie manuelito, i picked this one up based purely on name recognition. as i read the book, however, i began to wonder if it had actually been written by hillerman.
the plot involves washington, d.c. politicos involved in drug-running between mexico and the u.s. there is some soap-boxing about missing royalties owed native american tribes from the u.s. government, and a couple honorable assassins thrown in to spice things up.
the setup is interesting enough, with a man sent out to the four corners region to do some investigating, shot in the back, and then a follow-up investigation by sgt. jim chee. meanwhile, chee's would-be girlfriend has become border patrol officer manuelito down in the bootheel of new mexico. in fact, most of the action in the story is done by bernie, although leaphorn figures out most of the details with his powers of deduction and a couple maps. chee just kind of ties things together.
what disappointed me is that although the characters are moving along, the spirit seems to have gone out of hillerman's writing. the vivid details of the landscape and geography are missing, along with the spirituality of chee. most of the navajo cultural notes that made the earlier novels interesting are just kind of hinted at and it is assumed that the reader has read the other works. if this was the first hillerman mystery i picked up, i would probably skip the rest.","leaphorn, chee and bernie vs. international drug lords",1058659200,AL2VDE4LO4ESR,Jack Fitzgerald
241,3,"as i read this book, the thought that kept intruding that tony hillerman is no longer young (he'll be 78 this year). i strongly suspect that this book, which comes so strongly on the heels of  ""the wailing wind,"" may well be his last.

  other reviewers have noted that this book adds nothing new to our understanding of the central characters. but it does leave them with fewer unresolved issues than prior books. rather than being the cynical money-making effort depicted in some reviews below, this book appears to be a parting gift from an aging author who wanted to give the series a more satisfying closure than ""the wailing wind"" had left us with.

that said, it's not a great stand-alone book. the first chapter, which introduces the retiring cia agent who will soon become the murder victim, is painfully cliched, seemingly cobbled together from bad spy movies and political thrillers. the mystery is obvious (partly because huge chunks of it are told from the villains' perspective), and except for a little bit of magic with maps, leaphorn and chee get no chance to show off their detecting brilliance. the setting, in southern new mexico's ""boot heel"" region, is rendered generically, without the detail for which hillerman is famous-as though he'd written it from maps and memory. plot elements never connect, and there are gaps in the police procedure (most notably involving a car, which is missing in one chapter but has been fingerprinted in another chapter, with no mention that i could find of its being discovered).

the cobbled-together feel of this book, its lack of complexity, and its short length make me suspect that hillerman's health is failing and that he rushed it to completion while he still could. hopefully i'm wrong. regardless, readers of the series this book should save this book for last-it's merely an epilog to a long and honorable series. if you've read all the books, this one is a must read. if you've not, you'll be disappointed.

242,1,"unless you are an absolutely die hard fan -- save your money.  otherwise, this book is bound to be a disappointment.  the villain is utterly implausible, much of the plot centers in d.c. and chee and leaphorn are peripheral to the story. i have to say that i usually enjoy hillerman for the descriptions of the landscape and insights into navajo culture as much as the mystery itself.  this time, however, the plot is so implausible and the writing so flat that it detracted from the usual pleasures.  i also have to say, having lived in washington, dc for the past 12 years, that i found the portions of the book dealing with dc and federal politics completely absurd.  in fact, mr. hillerman so misunderstands the dc political game and his villain is painted in such broad strokes that it made me wonder whether his descriptions of navajo culture are equally bogus and inaccurate.  by the end of the book, i had come to question all his descriptions.
i also have to agree with all those who criticized the writing in this book.  many of the scenes read like outlines, particularly in the later chapters.  i've noticed that mystery writers with long established series frequently get lazy with the later books in the series (see martha grimes), but i do not understand why the publisher or editor does not insist that sparse scenes be fleshed out and that authors adhere to modicum of versimilitude.  i know that the authors of hillerman's stature will make money no matter how dreadful the writing but i would think the embarassment factor would kick in.",for die hard fans only,1057708800,A38FPECVKD1Y15,Harold Josephs

tony hillerman fans will be overjoyed to see a new mystery featuring the wonderful chee and leaphorn. both men are still struggling with their love interests, unable to quite put things together, suddenly inarticulate in the presence of the women they love. the sinister pig takes the mystery largely off the reservation and so misses out on the native american culture and religion that provides such a depth to many of hillerman's earlier chee and leaphorn novels.
hillerman is cynical about the war on drugs, recognizing that its biggest supporters include the smugglers themselves--criminals who would be out of business if drugs were legalized and who are willing to do virtually anything to prevent this disaster. as always in hillerman novels, the fbi is treated as incompetent and corrupt at the d.c. level, even as it sends its most talented agents into the hinterland. hillerman also takes a dig at the department of homeland security, recognizing that adding a layer of bureaucracy may not be the best way to improve safety.

this book, definitely the worst in the series, is as flat as a pancake from start to finish, with a ""mystery"" as complex as an encyclopedia brown story. chee and leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless, awkward exposition. side characters slide in and out with no real purpose. the only cop who hillerman seems to be interested in, the fetching bernie manuelito, becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy's game of drugs and power. even hillerman's trademark ansel adams-esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant. hillerman can't even figure out how to end it properly, resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic ""epilogue"" that seems like it was written two hours before deadline.
this series really does have a lot of legs in it, but hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving. perhaps it's time for someone else to take over with hillerman serving as consultant. because it would be a shame for chee and leaphorn to continue on the downward spiral that has plagued hillerman's most recent efforts.",a thief of my time...,1055808000,AO6U3C5QH8CON,Samuel Louis
249,3,"this book seems to be tony hillerman attempting to masquerade as james patterson. some familiar characters, a murder and related violence, short chapters, almost continual action and extremely limited character development. (eliminate the many blank pages between chapters and it is barely two hundred small pages of large type. thus, it is overpriced.)
the story has great potential. it has the well known characters of sergeant jim chee of the navajo tribal police and bernie manuelito, now separated geograpically from chee as a rookie border patrol officer and with the future of their relationship in doubt. when a puzzling murder in chee's jurisdiction intersects with bernie's work, the retired ""legendary lieutenant "" joe leaphorn is called upon for consultation. at the same time there seems to be a puzzling interest emanating from a powerful source in washington, d.c. concerning the ramifications of the case.
there is an intimation that the dead man may have been investigating the actual scandal concerning the loss (probably due to a combination of theft, embezzlement, indifference and incompetence) of billions of dollars of royalties from the indian tribal royalty fund held in trust by the department of the interior. this is a topic with great potential for an author with hillerman's skills and knowledge, but it becomes peripheral to a pretty standard police procedural combined with the mystery of how the romance between bernie and jim will conclude. there is some excellent misdirection regarding both the nature of the underlying crinimal activity and its participants and who or what is the real ""sinister pig"". but a lot of the oppportunities to develop the potential plot complications and resultant suspense were simply never pursued. also, there were several loose ends that were never satisfactorily tied up despite the attempt to do so in the epilogue. (i cannot go into details without revealing too much of the plot.) it is almost as if hillerman had an outline for a wonderfully complex story and then decided it was too complicated and so decided to quickly bring this part of the story to a close and leave the rest for a sequel.
as the title of my review implies, a few elements helped me decide to generously round up my rating to three stars. first, the plot is clever, and there is sufficient misdirection to keep the reader's interest. second, it involves familiar characters. third, this is a incredibly fast read. it is definitely a book for a short trip or a rainy afternoon. so if you are a hillerman fan, lower your expectations and enjoy a few hours updating yourself on the latest happenings in new mexico.",(2 1/2) a disappointing effort saved by an ingenious plot,1055721600,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,Tucker Andersen
251,1,"ok, i thought, ""the wailing wind"" was an aberration, a hiccup in the career of a very good author.  but two points define a line, and ""the sinister pig"" plots mr. hillerman's career straight down.  in the corporate world you sometimes see a luminary from an earlier era who is ""rip"" -- retired in place -- just going through the motions, living on past glories and collecting the big bucks for his reputation, not his current work.  sadly, this describes tony hillerman, who has decided to stir around a few ashes, thow in a highly predictable conclusion, and call it a novel.  i bet he's laughing at his readers all the way to the bank.
as for the book itself, reviewers occasionally describe a film as ""ok for a 10-minute sketch on snl, but not a 90-minute feature.""  that's sinister pig for you: interesting premise but almost no plot or character development (call central casting for all the stereotypes), no suspense (you know from the start who's really a bad guy and who's really not), and the shallowest of literary style (like wailing wind, everyone is constantly ""grinning"" at everyone else).  the initial plot device, investigating diversion of indian royalty payments, is both interesting and topical -- it's really happening -- but couldn't lead to a facile wrap-up in a mere 224 pages, so mr. hillerman switches to just another standard contraband tale.  rest assured, the good guys prosper, the bad guys pay, and the bad guys who are really good guys ... well, what do you expect?
i did like the little polemics on stealing of indian royalties, the vested interest of both narcos and narcs in keeping the ""war on drugs"" going full steam, and the pervasiveness of corruption in high office, but they weren't enough to salvage an otherwise trivial work.

252,3,"the reading of this book became a real chore....i found myself reading just to be reading, but not really enjoying. the beginning of the book was confusing, boring and not very well written.  the pace did seem to pick up when there was more of chee/leaphorn. the last 9-10 chapters, which were good, sort of balanced out the first 17-18 which were mediocre, hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 star.  and, while i'm crabbing, i want to address the fairly recent practice of putting out 200 page books for $....  i'm beginning to read some of the lesser known authors with ""hefty"" books so that i feel that i am getting my ""money's worth"".",was this really written by hillerman?,1055376000,AH7ZG2XVL5WOW,Bobbrun
253,3,"this is not really a chee/leaphorn novel. it does not take place on the navajo reservation, neither chee nor leaphorn is really involved in the crime, and the crime really has nothing to do with navajo culture in any way. in fact, the effort to involve them comes off as contrived.
while bernie is more of a central character, she is a weak central character. all we find out about her is that she is sad and misses jim chee. we don't even get to see her as a very professional cop.
the most interesting character is actually budge (a hatchet man for a cartoonish very bad rich guy). if only the novel had been written about him, from his viewpoint, it could have been great. as it was, it was just an ok but forgettable standard cop/mystery story.
it couldn't even decide if it was going to be a story about exploitation of indian resources or about smuggling drugs. and while i support legalization of most drugs, the discussion of that in the book was heavyhanded and simplistic.
it really seemed as though hillerman had a bunch of topics and series plot developments on a checklist, but was searching for a real novel to slip them into. sadly, he came up with this threadbare framework instead.
the stylistic skill was as good as ever (thus the three stars), but you know what they say about putting lipstick on a pig....",disappointing,1055203200,A3HCPK54FATFO4,Mike Garrison
254,1,"i am a huge tony hillerman fan -- i've read each of his novels multiple times and have enjoyed all of them.  my favorites are dance hall of the dead and skinwalkers.
the sinister pig, simply put, is an awful book, and is not even close to the level hillerman has set for himself.  much of the action takes place on airplanes and in limousines, and next to nothing occurs anywhere close to the navajo reservation.  hillerman tries to introduce the flavor of the new mexico/mexico border region, but his descriptions do not even come close to the standard he set for the four corners area.  had i not been to this area many times myself (i grew up in arizona) i wouldn't be able to distinguish the border region from kentucky.  finally, the subtlety and grace of earlier hillerman character interaction -- leaphorn and emma, chee and mary landon, and so on -- has been blown away by a sudden urge by hillerman to make everything explicit.  yes, tony, we know chee loves bernie and bernie loves chee -- why do you have to pound it in to us in every single scene?
this book was, simply put, painful to read, and i wouldn't have finished it at all were i not such a big hillerman fan.  if you are new to hillerman, please please please do not begin with this poor work.  and if you haven't read every hillerman novel, probably multiple times, my advice is to put this one aside and go back to those books you haven't read, or haven't read in a while.  i really wonder, seriously, if hillerman farmed this out to some ghost writer -- it really has the feel of some poor shmuck trying to mimic hillerman's characters....... it's sad, because i had really hoped that tony had one or two good novels still left in him, but if the sinister pig is any indication, he doesn't.  very, very sad.",easily hillerman's worst -- very disappointing,1055203200,AMFB2GBB2O84X,Brakaian
255,3,"it almost seems as if hillerman is trying rush the leaphorn/chee serial to a happy ending for his readers so he can quit writing them.  in true hillerman form, the plot had great potential rooted in current events, but came up shallow.  for me it was reminiscent of some of hillerman's work in the 80s when he seemed obsessed with the professional killer who was in turn obsessed with his parents (which isn't necessarily bad, it worked very well in ""people of darkness"").  there are some twists and surprises, but not enough to save it.  even a bad hillerman leaphorn/chee story is a good read for me, but i was spoiled by ""sacred clowns"" and ""hunting badger""!!",shallow,1054771200,A2W4B5871IRPUD,J. Carmichael
258,1,"i am a big hillerman fan but found this book sadly lacking in the normal quality that i would expect from mr. hillerman. the story line as noted in other reviews was weak and thin to say the least. character development was left at the sketch level, and the plot was not supported by the narrative.
several examples of this include the plot line between chee and officer bernadette manuelito. it was simplified to the point where all we read about was his yearning for her, and her for him. the level of which was dime store at best. secondly, in trying to tie all the lead character's in, we find ourselves jumping from one simple story line connection to another. chee to leaphorn to bernadette manuelito, to an unknown power broker in washington, etc. the resolution of the story lines would have better off in a typical weekly tv show. since when did we see in a hillerman book, the paid killer letting his feelings get the better of him and saving both bernadette manuelito and the senator's girlfriend.
if someone wanted to read hillerman i would send them back to any of the previous books and tell them to stay away from this one.",disappointed,1054166400,A1HD50VEPZYO0O,Michael
263,2,"not since finding moon have i been so disappointed in tony hillerman.
when i buy a hillerman book, i don't want to read about an evil, faceless puppetmaster who pulls string in washington and wrecks havoc in the jim chee and joe leaphorn's 'four corners' of the world.
i want to read about problems on the reservation...or difficulties within the navajo tribal police...or about how the native americans are trying to preserve their ancient knowledge.....or about how joe leaphorn is finding a new life after the death of his beloved wife...or about how jim chee can't ever get it right with women.  i also want the book to be more than 240 pages.  this story felt like formula fiction, something hillerman has avoided up to now.
the story about siphoned off oil and gas probably needs to be told, but i think a non-fiction expose would be a better venue for unveiling what could possibly be the biggest heist in history.
i had another issue with the story.  i never for one minute believed the author's reasoning behind bernadette mauelito's leaving the navajo tribal police for a job with the board patrol.  bernie was too close to her family/clan to move to the mexican border.  it was completely out of character for her.  i would have understood a 'temporary assignment' with the feds, but having her choose to make that kind of radical move just never felt right.
for jim chee fans, the book does contain a pleasant surprise.  i look forward to seeing how chee handles it in the next story.
this is not hillerman's best -- but after so many good ones, he's due a hiccup.",even hillerman is allowed a miss once in a while....,1053734400,A18VICK1AMJS6B,Terry Mathews
264,5,"this latest hillerman mysery features all the usual (by now) characters, joe leaphorn, jim chee, louisa bourbonette, bernie manuelito, cowboy dashee, and a new hero, whose name i won't mention, because to do so might spoil some of the surprise, but i hope we will be seeing more of that person.

the action takes place in southwestern new mexico, the location of bernie's new job, and therein lies the missed opportunity.  if only tony hillerman had gotten together with judith a. jance and brought joanna brady in to help, there might have been two novels about the same events, this one and another by jance, from joanna brady's viewpoint.  i, for one, would have loved to read both, and i am sure i am not alone.

nonetheless, ""the sinister pig"" is a very enjoyable read, for which thank you, tony hillerman!  let us hope for many more to come!

the issue with the book is it makes all boy trains bad. i won't let my daughter (5 years)  read it either nor my son. messages are important no matter how stuble it creeps into their brains. when perhaps they are older i will let them read the book as an example of how unfair and ridiculous it is to vilify a whole gender. i admits t to over thinking ot. but thhats my right as a parent.",boys are not bad.,1383436800,A1RP4KAAIA3PYZ,Amazon Customer

707,5,"this is the first time that the 'little engine' has been published as a deluxe picture book. for this reason alone, it is unfair to compare it to the previous editions. the older editions are illustrated with small, simple, colored line drawings rather than lavish, full-page, full-color paintings.

long's illustrations are beautiful and, in my opinion, suit the story better than the old ones did. as i child, i was never quite sure if the clown and dolls were toys or people. long's illustration makes them obviously toys.

long's illustrations give the different locomotives distinct looks and personalities. the original illustrations for both previous editions of the book have locomotives that are virtually identical, except for being different colors. the passenger engine in long's illustration is a sleek, streamlined design with an arrogant, sneering expression, while the freight engine is a massive, dark iron, whale-like machine that looms over and peers down at the tiny clown.

it's unfortunate that the review from the school library journal was chosen by amazon for the editorial reviews, above. i'd like to correct some errors - the writer has her facts wrong about the history of this book.

what burg believes to be the original edition of the book is, in fact, the 1954 edition with illustrations by george and doris hauman. although burg praises the '1930s' look of these illustrations with the green poka-dotted clown, they scream '1950s!'. while most people today are familiar with this version, i think the older illustrations are showing their age, and i believe children today will relate better to long's paintings. also, as i have stated above, i believe long's illustrations help tell the story better.

the actual 1930s illustrations were colored line drawings by lois lenski, and few people today will have seen them. interestingly, those illustrations show the story taking place in a stark, snow-covered winter landscape.

burg claims loren long's paintings have a '1950s' look. anyone familiar with painting styles of the 1930s will recognize the influence of painters like grant wood on long's style. long's illustrations are much truer to the 1930s than the 1954 illustrations are.

i am a friend of loren long's, and i know how hard he worked on these illustrations and how much this book meant to him. these paintings were a labor of love.",rebutting the editorial reviews for this book,1128384000,ADHXMCKVD6XAB,Paul Schliesser
717,3,"this is one of the great children's stories of all time. i loved it as a child and read it over and over again, and my son has been demanding it as a bedtime story regularly since he was2-1/2 years old. the 1991 platt &  munk (a division of grosset & dunlap) edition, beautifully illustrated  by cristina ong, leaves out all the requests made to the busy trains. the  story is now very brief (which is why i give it only 3 stars instead of the  5 the full-length version deserves)--i suppose because it is a board  book--but the essentials are all there. it also changes the sex of the  engines from male to female, so perhaps some parents would like to read  this edition to their children as well as one of the others.",abridged edition,948326400,A146ZXWRE98ZWX,Bill Franke
721,5,"thirty years ago, i was taught to read with this. different pictures, same poems. i learned to imagine and believe in ordinary, yet beautiful things. even  today, in my own writing, i smile realizing how and when i learned a technique ... just by listening to my mother whisper these poems  nightly.

aptly named, rls has the reader remembering the wonderful days  of playing alone and with friends, of delighting in the moment.

your  child will gain an understanding of classic children's poetry, of the  rhythm and rhyme. they sound eloquent aloud, and read gentle at bedtime.

1079,5,"i am not going to get up today (beginner books) by dr. seuss is a whimsical fantasy tale that should appeal to very young children. as another reviewer notes, young kids are full of energy; they don't truly want to stay in bed and this book won't encourage them to do that, either. however, the story makes a great fantasy and the book is also a solid educational tool for children learning to read.

the story is relatively simple; a young boy is tired and he wants to take the day off and lounge in bed. he is rather obstinate; even his mother and a cop can't get him out of bed! along the way, the young child learns a lot about the english language and reading--and that's great.

children are introduced to names of places including paris, massachusetts, berlin, alaska, china, spain and more! this can easily generate a conversation with your child about what foreign (or distant) places are like; and the child can get a good basic understanding that the world is really a very large place with many different cultures.

this book also teaches children the sounds that some things make. for example, the book, usually through the use of text that rhymes, mentions how birds ""peep;"" how an alarm clock ""rings;"" how a bed can be ""warm"" and how a pillow can be ""deep."" great!

i suppose that for some very active children the idea of a child taking a rest in bed could show them an example of the importance of learning to rest.

overall, i am not going to get up today is another fine children's book by the great dr. seuss; and i recommend this book heartily for parents to read with their very young children. the book is an excellent educational tool that helps children learn to read and understand words, places and other concepts like ""warm"" and ""deep.""

that's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  i have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being dr. schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  it would have been a much better book if dr. schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.

science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  there is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.","sound argument, badly structured",1245456000,A2XQMGE2YY88DC,Jiang Xueqin

1089,2,"schwarcz is a professor of chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. judging by this book i'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.

i'm not saying that schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. after you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. hey, is there any nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?

i majored in biology at college, so i thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. i was wrong. i can't really fault schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. but the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about ""the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat."" again i was wrong, and this time i can fault schwarcz. schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so i wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? he recommends that meat should be ""an occasional treat,"" and even then the portion size ""should cover a small portion of the plate."" those people who still believe in the ""myth"" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue schwarcz's book than read it. regarding other myths and misconceptions, schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. i suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.

i can't forgive the chapter on milk. his discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. he doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. he doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. one study shows that ""asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than westerners even though they consume less dairy."" schwarcz responds by saying, ""true enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle."" he leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the ""very different diet and lifestyle"" are healthier! he then mentions the comprehensive nurses' health study ""which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures."" schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! i say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. to make things worse, schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who ""criticizes"" milk consumption as part of the ""antimilk lobby,"" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. i eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and i'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean i must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? schwarcz says that when we ""look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium."" schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. but again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. furthermore, schwarcz dismisses ""antimilk"" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. he's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).

this is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as publishers weekly says, that ""leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.""? i'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. in the end, the best that schwarcz can do is tell us that milk ""is not a poison,"" as some fringe members of peta might say.

in conclusion, schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. you know the drill: eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. if you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!",a chemistry experiment gone bad!,1238976000,A359IT81FBX64Y,Steven Mason
1090,2,"i bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books on amazon.ca. i've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. this is the only one i sent back.

coming from a canadian author, i was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled ""milk and calcium"", i lost a lot of respect for this man as a ""nutrition authority"".

i think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor, is painfully obvious.

he portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/don-t-drink-your-milk-new-frightening-medical-facts-about-the-world-s-most-overrated-nutrient/dp/0945383347/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">don't drink your milk!: new frightening medical facts about the world's most overrated nutrient</a>&nbsp;( while this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)

he acknowledges that, ""milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!""

he fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health.

that the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable ph level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body.

he continues, ""but milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"".

""the anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning."" ( again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. that in nature, no other species would ever consume the ""breast milk"" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) ""that's hardly a compelling argument. no other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.""

he tries to refute the nurse's health study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. so, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater osteoporotic risk in general. therefore, milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the nurse's health study. as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough, to overcome the higher  risks within this ""self-selected subgroup"". while the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, dr. walter willett, does not.

in this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a ""trace of dioxin"". he acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and limit saturated fats from elsewhere.

he doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary milk protein. likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. there's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.

most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. the dairy industry likes to mislead and deceive the public by measuring ""water"" weight, rather than counting calories.

this author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. he boasts, ""a glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. by comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.""

of course, he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. he does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.

there is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world's population are lactose intolerant. apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. but centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of africa and asia, decimating cattle populations. so, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their ""natural"" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.

while some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production and antibiotics to ward off the sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions ( at least in most of the u.s. ), much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk, is destroyed through pasteurization. and dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food north americans are likely to ingest.

the author claims that while ""milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. it assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of peta"".

webster's dictionary defines poison as, ""a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill"".

it's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is ( as even the weston a. price foundation will acknowledge ), crap!

while ""milk and calcium"" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. do i now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? no!

who do i trust?

despite having just said it was a good read it unfortunately was not what i had hoped for. i am in to statistics myself, more as an amature stats guy as i don't dabble in statistics professionally nor do i have an educational background in it, however i am self taught and fairly knowledgeable and that made reading this book comparable to gearing up to watch a gory hostel type horror movie and instead ending up watching dracula staring bela lugosi.

i recommend this book for anyone wanting to gain some knowledge on statistics and probability from a real world percpective. the author definitely delivers there. for anyone who would like to learn more, like how variables affect outcome and what should be taken in to consideration when making those calculations, this book is not for you.",struck by simplicity,1230422400,A3QXFMHA96AA8N,Geoff Howard
1209,2,"maybe i've been spoiled after reading freakonomics, which was so clever and unique it was hard to put down,  but i found this book to be pretty dull in comparison. most of the examples were just not that interesting or unique topics to read about, such as gambling odds, political polls, crime statistics and a rehash of the monte hall problem from parade magazine, which was widely written about years ago.",not exactly freakonomics,1202256000,A11OQUV1ZI2MT2,Soccerfan
1211,4,"this book is written in short, digestible bites, and offers one of the best overview answers i've read to everyone's perennial question, ""what are the odds?""

early chapters are a primer on casino games. in less than an hour, you can read up on how the major casino games are played, how to calculate your odds of winning in many common situations - and how much you will lose on every play on average if you play for any length of time. rosenthal emphasizes this last proviso. he shows how every casino game is stacked against the players and will whittle away your stake to nothing in the long run. but some games offer better odds and will deplete you less rapidly than other games.

then rosenthal moves on to tell you how to win at the game of life - or more precisely, how not to be caught up in the frequent illogic and hysteria that is generated by headline news and tv shows. he gives a better perspective on what kinds of dangers you are likely to actually face - and they are not terrorists or sars or street crime.

a few more mathematically challenging topics are addressed  - such as the monty hall dilemma, and how trends are spotted using linear regression lines. rosenthal makes the calculation of p-values (used to determine how often a result will happen just by chance) almost comprehensible.

some of his suggestions about using utility theory when we have to reach a decision may be of questionable value. probably many of us have tried to make decisions ""rationally"" by using some formula that involves assigning some level-of-desirability number to each of our options, then considering how likely it is that the benefits of that option will actually materialize. but such calculations usually break down almost immediately in the maze of diverging possibilities we have to consider.

however one of rosenthal's applications of utility theory stands up and has implications for public policy. he shows how statistics lead to the conclusion that it is unreasonably costly to insure oneself against anything except utter catastrophes. this section of his book is something everyone should consider when buying insurance, especially health insurance. and it's something our elected officials in particular should inform themselves about before proposing any health care legislation.

rosenthal provides other valuable insights that might shield us and reassure us when facing health care issues. for example, he demonstrates how statistically unlikely it is that you have a certain disease if just one test for that disease comes back positive. for further statistical discussions of this counterintuitive fact, i recommend any of marilyn vos savant's books.

""struck by lightning"" provides ample insight on its own though. it's entertaining, and it contains information you're very likely to use in everyday life.",this book is a good bet,1174262400,A387BD735MI50R,R. Schultz

1443,3,"i'm not really sure what to think about this book. i mean, i read it when i was a kid; i had it read to me. it's a classic book. but i'm trying to look at it with fresh eyes.

it's well-written. it's well-rhymed. it's funny. the pictures are amusing. but the story basically boils down to this: a character, who is never named, is sitting reading a newspaper. this other guy, sam, keeps rushing by him with signs on various animals, annoying him, and it's unclear why sam's doing it, and then he offers the main character green eggs and ham. the main character replies that he doesn't like them, at which point sam begins a litany of questions at this guy. ""would you like them here or there?"" ""would you like them in a house?"" ""would you like them in a car?"" sam just follows the guy around, going through these ridiculous situations, trying to get him to eat this frankly moldy-looking food. at the end, they end up falling in the ocean (i think) with the main character, again, vehemently denying that he likes this food, like he's got some kind of thing to prove about it or something, and then sam finally suggests to the main character that he try them. the main character says, ""if you will let me be/i will try them, you will see."" basically, ""if eating this food is what it takes to get you to leave me alone and stop destroying my life with all this random crap going on, i will."" and then he eats them, and he likes them.

i think it's supposed to be a metaphor for trying to get children to try new foods, because children will often deny that they like something without ever having tried it. most adults don't claim to dislike a food before they've ever tried it. i guess children do sometimes come up with strange rules about when and where they will eat certain things (and i guess i do know of at least one adult who refuses to eat hot dogs unless she is at a baseball game). taken in that light, it makes a lot of sense. taken the way the world works for adults, it's basically one person harassing another person, until they consume dangerous-looking food. that would be like chasing somebody around, practically assaulting them with animals and vehicles, until they agree to eat leftover tuna that's been in the fridge for who knows how long.

again, as i said, if you take it from the perspective that a child will likely take it, i'm probably reading too much into it. a child will look at it and think, ""oh, there's a lot of food i don't like, and my parents sometimes resort to ridiculous lengths in order to get me to eat food that i claim to not like, and it sometimes turns out that i like it,"" so i think they'll identify with that. i guess the important part is that the main character does like it.

but there's no real reason given in the story for sam to be an authority on food. in fact, in the beginning the main character says he doesn't even like sam. there's no reasons given for anything in this book, at all. you can make up your own reason. you can say that sam is trying to give the main character a gift of something that sam really, really, likes, knowing it's not dangerous, but declines to explain that to the main character. and the main character thinks it looks dangerous, but declines to explain that to sam. despite the entire text being dialogue, there's not enough communication going on in this book. it kind of reminds me of the conversations i have with my own toddlers, so i guess it's accurate.

the message is kind of mixed from a modern perspective. again, the book is very well written, the rhymes are excellent, and the meter is impeccable. dr. seuss: great writer. i'm just not sure i agree with the message of this book.

message: try new foods. or, if you keep annoying somebody enough, they'll give in to what you're asking for.

1560,3,"a warning tale about life in picture book form. it's almost dorothy-like in its ending

my take
watch where you're walkin'!
it's a hazardous journey through life with problems popping and flitting, darting and biting, raining and flooding  without toothpaste or soap! and, poor cat. his journey is so much longer than he expectedand isn't that the way for all of us.

it's a series of troubles that gets deeper and deeper, from a camel needing a ride, to the nastier part of that particular lesson and right down deeper into the tunnel under pamplemoose.

i do enjoy the colors seuss uses in his books. they're rarely primary colors, but more nuanced and normally consistently used throughout the story. in i had trouble in getting to solla sollew, suess was totally inconsistent in his colors. some were deep and grayed while others were bright and cheery. it could be a reflection of cat's experiences as he travels.

if nothing else, i always enjoy the scenes and characters that seuss creates.

i certainly did like the button-like flowers outside that trap door. that field of flowers almost paled, though, when the city of solla sollew appeared with its towers and arches and frivolity too.

i had trouble in getting to solla sollew is a microcosm of life, as cat discovers there are hidden perils everywhere and that running away from your problems doesn't necessarily get you in the clear.

the story
rocks, the evil-minded, green-headed quilligan quail, a skirtz, and a skrink pop up from all directions, leaving cat thinking this chap in his one-wheeler wubble has the answers to his troubles.

it's a hard lesson to learn, and not so hard to go back.

the characters
cat is from the valley of vung.

dr. sam snell knows all about camels.

butch meyers is the usual bus driver. horace p. sweet is the bus line president.

general genghis khan schmitz inducts cat into his army to battle the perilous poozer of pompelmoose pass.

the naughty key-slapping slippard can't be killed, as the doorman moans.

the midwinter jicker is a nasty rainy sort of storm.

the cover and title
the cover has a white background and is framed by a seussian blob of deep pink that starts as a lumpy hillside on the left tumbling down to the bottom of the cover only to rise up as a long swaying trunk with a high umbrella-like canopy at the very top. calmly stepping from hillock to hillock is a bright yellow camel hitched to a blue one-wheeler wubble to which a rusty looking cat is clinging.

1955,1,"**spoiler alert** i will give away the ending so stop reading if you don't want the spoiler.
synopses: a local dealer pressures a buyer into ingesting a strange substance for ""free"". during 80% of the book, the protagonist clearly says ""no"", but the substance dealer continues to pressure. in the end the protagonist is defeated, ingests the substance, and shows signs of addiction proclaiming outrageous ways in which he'll take this new substance. there is no evidence that the antagonist will continue to provide free samples of the substance once the main character is addicted.
this is done in rhyme & marketed to children. many parents view this as a very positive book (as you can see from the reviews on amazon). this author probably has 3 books in my top ten creepiest books of all time. like this one, most antagonists exhibit extreme lack of respect of individual boundaries and dismiss the protests and views of others in careless disregard.","better titles: ""no means yes: a guide to manipulating others"" or ""how i became an addict""",1394496000,A1GQRCACHQ3SG5,Sockanasa
1963,3,"this book of course has a good message--be open-minded, be willing to try new things, and don't make up your mind about things without trying them--but for me as a child, the most enjoyable thing about reading it was the way the words sounded. they rolled off the tongue and were easy to memorize and recite along with mom or dad, and it went on for such a long time with sam i am popping up in increasingly absurd places and situations to try to get the protagonist to try green eggs and ham. i was a little annoyed in later years that maybe sam couldn't just take a hint and respect the main character's opinion--i mean heck, if he wants to live his life unaware of the glory that is eating green eggs and ham, it's his right, isn't it?--but considering he didn't really seem to have a reason to not try it except for sheer stubbornness, i didn't think this message was problematic.

another reason i like green eggs and ham is because it is easy to read .i think it's easy to read because pictures helps you.

2064,1,"this book is suitable with adults with its message that ""the devil you know is better than the one you don't know"", but for children it is just scary. the protagonist dreams of a better place, where he doesn't get attacked, and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems, he runs into more and more problems, some of them being violent, others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children. the ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream, but the return to the beginning, to the problems he knows. maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape, but children need the mystical place and a happy ending, which this book certainly doesn't have. the last picture is one of violence.

the second thing that struck me, only after a couple of readings, is that despite the english title, the hebrew version does not mention what is on the plate at all.  this is probably a strategic move, as many hebrew-speaking children either wouldn't know what ham was or would be disgusted by it (and not just by its greenness!).

the hebrew title translates literally to, ""i'm not hungry and i don't like it.""  what ""it"" is remains a mystery.  luckily, there is still the happy ending to look forward to, when ""sheiv,"" the beleaguered central character (sam, in english), gets to taste the greenish substance and acknowledge that, hey, he may have been a little hungry after all.

in any language, with a translation this good, this is a fun book to read, and i'd highly recommend this to english-speaking families, like ours, who are trying to build up a library of hebrew translations of familiar stories.","not ""green eggs and ham"" in hebrew!",1272153600,A3K77GJCI8FRYU,"Jennifer Tzivia MacLeod, author of the Seven Day Manuscript Machine and Writing the Bible for Kids"

(not to mention its descriptions say things like ""from the entrance you can see..."" without acknowledging that there are 6 separate entrances to the site or clarifying which one it's referring to.) it also provides distinctly un-insightful history saying things like ""[name] was the person who gave real meaning to the abbreviation s.p.q.r"" but without actually telling you what spqr stands for or how the person gave it meaning. perhaps the book is a decent refresher for people who already know rome's history, but don't expect any insight into things you don't already know. and it's definitely not a guide to carry with you--the maps are tiny and illegible with 3-point type, and the information too dense to find things quickly--it's laid out and reads like a 400 page novel.",dense and unhelpful for first-time tourists,1079222400,ALUV2YKWZENKK,Amazon Customer

2355,1,"there's a reason this book's popularity pales in comparison with the gazillion other wonderful books dr. seuss created.  i believe dr. seuss was a genius, and my political leanings are in line with his.  the only explanation i can come up with for this book is that it wasn't intended for children or non-violent adults, but rather to send to war mongers to show them the error of their ways.  my five and seven year old daughters found it downright disturbing.  i ""accidentally"" skipped over much of it when i saw the look of sadness, concern, and utter confusion on their faces.  it details a war between two nations, and the somewhat silly names for the weaponry are not nearly enough to make the increasingly morbid arms race palatable.

there are just so many better dr. seuss books: for big kids and adults, try ""did i ever tell you how lucky you are"", ""oh, the places you will go"", or ""happy birthday to you""; for little kids, read ""one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish"", ""go dog, go!"", and ""dr. seuss's abc"".  these are a much better representation of this man's talent, and just a tiny taste of the incredible treasures he left for the world to enjoy.

2363,4,"the title above should be prefaced by 'as far as i know', since i haven't read everything by dr. seuss, but anyway...

this book tries to show the folly of war, specifically the cold war, and arms races, by all of dr. seuss's usual tricks: the creation of new words for objects representative of things in our own world, and beautiful, colorful environments which act as twisted mirror images of our own world.  the book also, however, can be viewed as showing the necessity of arms races, since, as the book implies, if one side doesn't match the threat of the other, than the other will strike.  the only problem i see with it though, is that the entire book, especially the ending, might be a bit too much for younger kids, which is what dr. seuss's audiance has become.  sadly older children (10 to 12) would probably much rather read something that seems more mature, since by this age they're perfectly capable of reading chapter books.

a surprisingly well writen political commentary by a children's author, the butter battle book can easily be viewed as a seuss classic.",seuss's darkest and most political work,1103500800,A1FZI1F22GRO4C,Richard Veysey

2433,5,"revising this after 40 years, i find that it still hold up extraordinarily well both in its approach and content.  its insights and commentary are especially surprising since this book was written less than ten years after hemingway's death.

this really should the first hemingway biography you read and certainly not the last.  it was written when the great man's shadow still hovered the literary scene.  if you want to see how present day and post 60's attitudes toward hemingway developed, this book will give you  clue. unlike many of the critical analyses of hemingway, this book attempts to give you a glimpse into the life that was lived that produced such a great writer  warts and all yet no ax to grind.  i think that many of those who purport to study him really resent him for his talent.  he is one of those writers who seem to be a model for many aspiring authors.  these learn too late that they think that "" i can write like that"" but can't and therefore become bitter.and revel in their hatred, yes hatred, of the man (whom they never met) and works which they have read only once.

i would caution many readers new to hemingway to be aware of a surfeit of hemingway biographies and reminiscences  which were only written by ""pilot fish"" intent to cash in on the hemingway myth with spurious claims to a familiarity with him.

yes i am biased when it comes to hemingway but i find that the chapter which concerns hemingway's suicide and mental illness to have been handled with the utmost tact and civility. as for the man remember that this was written before the publication of ""the garden of eden."" now that book would stun hemingway's denigrators.",scholarship not lurid journalism,1403136000,A1MQYS867NLHYJ,propertius

2444,3,"the first novel, airborn, is fabulous. the sequel had so much to live up to and it disappoints on several levels: there's the odd spelling mistake, some errors in syntax, and those are forgivable; however, the shallow character development and the overall pace and direction of the sub-plots feels hurried, at times issues are just glossed over like simpkins supposed romance. the novel at times reads like it was half-baked and the publisher rushed it to market before letting mr. oppel really flesh out his characters. it's more plot driven than airborn. that's not to say airborn has no plot, it's there but the character development is done with such finesse and interwoven with the plot that it succeeds in a way that skybreaker fails to attain. skybreaker's characters seem one dimensional in comparison. for example matt's father is often mentioned in airborn and is always a haunting reminder of what matt aspires to; in skybreaker his father is more of an afterthought and would have made a perfect appearance when icarus (matt) falls through the sky (think the scene when matt is flung off the side of the aurora and how that was deeply tied to his father). i love the ties to the sherpas given the ships name, but i felt they were secondary characters that could have played a larger role or at least been given more depth to their raison dtre in this tapestry. as much as i enjoyed the plot, i feel there could have been more to this story. gone is the feeling i had of matt in airborn, a feeling of excitement that only a young d'artagnan obtaining his promotion can compare: the underdog moving up the ladder and breaking barriers once thought impossible.",at times issues are just glossed over like simpkins supposed romance,1424908800,A3P2BN03TKIPQS,jsvfoto

in this one, the second book, matt cruse and his friend kate de vries find themselves on an adventure to find a lost airship, dangling somewhere in the frigid, unwelcoming atmosphere. as usual, trouble finds them and follows them aboard the ship. they fight for their lives and for the honor of the man who owned the lost airship. they make amazing discoveries and take their findings back with them.

unlike airborn, skybreaker spends most of its time in the sky, and i felt that it was more enjoyable for that (and more of a page turner) as a result.  plus the subject matter was more interesting to me, as i suspect it will be for most people (and the customer reviews here seem to support that notion).  it's a real rip-roaring adventure.

they're in development on a movie version of airborn, but assuming it does well enough to allow a sequel, it's the sequel that will be the better film (if it lives up to the material).

hopefully there will be a third book and more.  i'll definitely be there for them if they continue to be as well written as these first two.  actually that's another point i should make:  the writing is very good.  i mean the real nitty-gritty of the writing-- the word choices, the pacing, the mood, the well-placed humor, etc.  it's very vivid without going into too much detail, and it reads very smoothly.",even better!,1173571200,AA266SRDPZCNH,Fred

to me it was an over-complicated story about a communist college professor who leaves america to go fight in a communist rebellion in spain during which he is ordered to blow up a bridge. along the way he seduces some local teenage girl, who is desperate to feel loved after being raped and abused. we'd definitely call it pedophilia today, due to their age differences. he also reminisces about living it up and rubbing elbows with the communist leaders in a posh hotel they've commandeered. he listens to some stories about the heinous atrocities and war crimes the communists commit in the outset of the uprising.

i really wanted to like this and persevered to past the half way point. but when i got to the stage where i was dreading picking up the book as i was finding it so monotonous, i decided enough was enough--it was going back to the library from whence it came.

the lengthy novel tells the story of robert jordan, a young american in the international brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the spanish civil war. as a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack on the city of segovia.

by the half-way point, he still hadn't blown up the bridge but was instead engaging in seemingly never-ending debate about why it needed blowing up, how to do it, whether or not everyone in his group was in favour of the destruction .....the list could go on but i will spare you. i turned each page wondering if it would be the culmination of 250 pages of planning but sadly it was not to be. or maybe that was a good thing because the soldiers guarding the bridge were spared for another day.

imagine writing down every single action you take in a typical day from morning until evening whether relevant and interesting or not. then gather a group of people and ask them to do the same. then merge the pages and you have this book.

there is limited bad language although i found it amusing that for the stronger language they have simply inserted the word ""obscenity"" whether it made sense or not. there is some violence and some sexual content. the content wasn't offensive enough to put me off. i just thought this was extremely dull...

this entire book is basically a love story between main character, robert jordan, and maria, set against the spanish civil war. what makes this so unrealistic is that the book takes place entirely over only three days, and at the beginning of the book jordan and maria have not yet met. so, in the course of just three days, we are expected to believe that they go from complete strangers to in love in a way that defies comprehension. not only is this unrealistic, but it is also so boring. there are literally entire chapters of just robert jordan and maria telling each other how much they love each other.

this book is described as a war novel, but its only a war novel in the sense that it takes place during the war. there is very little actual war that happens in this book.

basically, the book is boring. it was a struggle to get through, and i only finished it because my ocd forces me to finish books i have started. but i hated it.",just too boring to stand.,1465516800,A350UZ4XET6326,A. Dude

yes, hemingway (or rather ernest hemingway) does have a way with words when describing character's inner thoughts during wartime and maybe it didn't bother me as much as other reviewers.  i think this novel is considered a ""classic"" because ernest hemingway (darn, he's got me doing it now) was pretty much the first to write in his style, maybe not, maybe i'm reaching here).

2658,2,"the entire book only covers four days and three nights, but hemingway's writing makes it seem more like four months.  the stilted dialogue (much of it presented as literal translations of spanish) is irritating and unnecessarily drawn out.  rather than having concise conversations, characters engage in irritating back-and-forth babble that serves no purpose (along the lines of:  ""i am going to check on the horses.""  ""the horses?""  ""yes, the horses.""  ""those are fine horses.  can i go?""  ""no, man, you cannot go.""  ""are you sure i cannot go?"" etc., etc., until you are ready to pull your hair out).  the entire book could have been much more effectively told if it had been trimmed-down by at least a third.

hemingway often reveals background information and history through thought sequences, but these are often awkwardly done.  he will interrupt a scene or even a conversation to have a character go on a mental frolic for, sometimes, several pages before returning to the story.  since it is hard to imagine a person actually doing this -- one imagines that the character must have slipped into a several-minute trance to have thought so much -- it would have been much more effective and far less irritating to have conveyed this information via omniscient narration.

in addition to stylistic problems, the story suffers from horrible plot decisions by hemingway.  as the story begins, maria has only weeks earlier been imprisoned and gang-raped by fascist sympathizers, yet she is so smitten with robert jordan that she comes to him in the middle of his first night in camp and has sex with him.  to say this is horribly unrealistic is putting it mildly.  making matters worse, maria has to be one of the least-appealing female love interests in literary history:  she is portrayed as a simpering fool, stupid, whining, and generally irritating.  any time there is serious work to be done or danger at hand, she turns into a ball of goo and wants to play kissy-face with robert.  one expects her to break into baby-talk at any moment.

a further plot problem involves the cunning pablo.  after building up the tension with the guerrilla leader throughout the book, pablo's ultimate betrayal and abrupt reconciliation are written so poorly as to be both anticlimactic and unbelievable.

all of that said, the book contains some well-drawn, complex characters -- particularly an older fighter named anselmo -- and the last third of the story does have some excellent dramatic tension.  all in all, however, this is a case of an opportunity squandered.",overrated,1444867200,A2SPNF0WMXK932,Ben G

2667,4,"for whom the bell tolls is a highly acclaimed war novel by master writer ernest hemingway. it was published in 1940 and tells the story of robert jordan, a young american in the international brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the spanish civil war. as a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack. hemingway describes the life of leftist guerrilla fighters in a series of skirmishes and camp fire vignettes; plunging the reader into a world of pine tree forests and counter intelligence. the characters of the morally repugnant and swine-eyed pablo, as well as the strong willed pilar, are indeed memorable. what sets this novel apart from othersis hemingways own economical and inimitable style. hemingway wrote without ornamentation  a symptom of his having been a journalist  and could evoke great emotion with his select choice of words. the recount of sordos last stand, for example, is a particularly harrowing part in the book. hemingways larger than life reputation preceded him when he was alive. he won the nobel prize for literature; as well as a pulitzer prize for his novella the old man and the sea. hemingways fiction seemed to fuel the legend that surrounded him as an author. he had served as an ambulance driver in ww1and much later travelled to spain as a journalist to cover the civil war there; and no doubt his first-hand experiences inspired and helped to colour his writing. the book has various themes at its heart such as idealism and the fight against fascism (ie. fighting the good fight)as well as death in war, the transitory nature of life etc. the title of the book, for whom the bell tolls, comes from a line in a john donne poem and is in reference to the symbolic funeral bell and the kinship all men share because of their mortality - no man is an island, entire of itselffor whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.",rings a bell,1441324800,AKB010PC6G7KZ,Brent McGregor

2702,3,"broccoli author: great american novelists such as melville, steinbeck and hemingway that you should read because ""they're good for you.""
for whom the bell tolls is this kind of book.
it meets all the criteria of great literature. hemingway is never overly explicit. each scene and character serves multiple purposes. the author weaves his themes of humanity, the morality of war and each metaphysical peal of the ""bell"" into his narration, slowly building up to the climax.
therein lies the problem with this classic novel. it is very slow and tedious with enough archaisms to rival your kjv bible. you'll also be running for your spanish dictionary, as hemingway cleverly substitutes all foul language by either changing the english spelling (""muck"" for the f-bomb for example) or inserting the spanish word as he does when one character refers to two others as ""maricones."" the book's setting (spain) isn't readily apparent at first so don't feel bad if you get lost. look for hemingway's nod to gertrude stein on page 289.
the main plot is introduced immediately. the protagonist and his new group of friends must blow up a bridge as an act of war. unfortunately, it takes them over 400 pages to do this. everyone talks too much in this book. everyone has a story to tell. stream of consciousness abounds, serving more as filler than enhancing the plot. the three days they spend planning, discussing and contemplating the risks of their mission feel like a lifetime.
indeed, even the main protagonist himself, robert jordan, thinks on this, as his life is especially changed after meeting and falling in love with the beautiful ""honey bunny"" maria (who is affectionately referred to as ""rabbit"" which comes off as misogynistic but, hey, that's hemingway!) their gentle love story and hemingway's fascinating ability to create inoffensive sex scenes in a sleeping bag were all that kept me turning pages. there's also an implied impregnation at the end. robert, maria and pilar would've make quite the kick-ass team going after maria's rapists and avenging all the boco harams of the world. but in the words of tony stark to dum-e, ""you are a tragedy,"" because that's the novel hemingway set out to write.

my goal in life has been, for years, to read at least one of the classics each month. so i am quite able to appreciate the differences in various writing styles starting with homer and all  his descendants.

for example, a few months ago i read lord jim, by james conrad. as a reader, i found it quite intriguing. as a writer, i found myself highlighting many passages that caught my imagination with conrads beautiful prose that delivered complex ideas or emotions, and vivid descriptions that imprinted themselves on my mind.

in contrast, in fwtbt i found only two passages particularly memorable. the writing, aside from its many new and unique techniques, is definitely literary, as opposed to the story-tellers. i also found hemingways style to be ponderous and repetitious

i will start by saying that it took me ages to finish this book. i'd read the old man and the sea a long time ago and i was curious about hemingway's masterpiece, but once i started to read it i found it difficult to get into the story. one thing that contributed to that was the writing style. i had heard that it was raw and that the writing was very blunt, but i found it to be beyond that. sometimes i had the feeling that i was reading a telegram. specially when it came to the dialogues. had hemingway put a stop word at the end of a dialogue sentence and i wouldn't be surprised!

a thing that i found unnecessary was the romance. the only way for me to describe robert jordan's and maria insta love is by calling it tarzan level. it can me summarized into this: we just met, but i love thee! thou loves me? let us get into bed and do things! - end of love story. so i ask: why? why put romance into this when there's none?

where i found interest in this story was in robert jordan's thoughts and feelings towards his path in life and his faith.

so, in short i didn't dislike it but i can say i liked it as well.

2817,3,"for whom the bell tolls by ernest hemingway is the story of robert jordan, a young man who is caught up making explosives for the rebels in the spanish civil war. he's contemplative and slow-to-act, the opposite of the explosives he is in charge of detonating.

we meet up with jordan once he is tasked to blow up a bridge, a bridge that is pivotal to the war effort. he goes into the mountains to meet with a band of rebels who are to help him destroy the bridge and attack the base on the other side of the bridge. jordan meets and falls in love with a young spanish woman maria and the story reaches it's climax when he is forced to make a tough decision and blow the bridge without the proper equipment.

like many of hemingway's novels, for whom the bell tolls was quite wordy. there was a lot of talk and not a lot of action. honestly, i preferred hemingway's the old man and the sea and a farewell to arms. the novel was interesting. i'm glad i powered through it, as it is considered a classic, but not my favorite of his work. excellent writer, but i've seen better work out of him.

2826,1,"i somehow managed to get through high school & college without encountering hemingway.  i had also never read the catcher in the rye, of mice and men, etc. so a few years ago i decided that i needed to read some of the ""classics"" that i missed.  i loved to read in high school, mostly stephen king, tom clancy, w.e.b. griffin, etc.  however, even though i liked reading i found that most of the books i was assigned to read were painful (wuthering heights & ethan frome stand out as particularly horrible examples!) and i developed an almost visceral reaction to the suggestion that any books were ""classics"".  as an adult i decided it was time to go back and try to cherry pick classis that i might like (sorry, no tess for me) and try to broaden my knowledge of the ""classics""  my mission was actually going well, & i had found a lot of books that i really liked, and i thought that a good war story by an author as well regarded as hemingway was a great next choice.

i will not presume to say that i am right & that millions who love this book are wrong, but i really do not understand why this book is considered a classic.  the dialogue is so choppy & forced-formal that it seems like the characters are all talking past each other.  i think it must have something to do with a spanish translation but it really distracted from the plot.  bottom line is that i have seldom gotten less involved in a story.  i made it 3/4 of the way through & decided that i did not care if the bridge got blown  up or not and stopped.  i just found the whole thing to be a bloated and a drudging read for what should have been a rather simple (and exciting) story.  i think more than anything else it was the dialogue that put me off, but it will definitely be my last encounter with hemingway.

2869,3,"""for whom the bell tolls"" tells the story of young american spanish teacher who goes to volunteer in the spanish civil war. the entire novel takes place over 72 hours in which robert jordon, the young american, is responsible, as part of a bigger attack, to bomb a bridge and by that ensure that the fascists won't be able to send reinforcements after the attack has begun. during those intense 72 hours, robert jordon falls in love with maria, a spanish girl whose family was murdered by the fascists. (isn't it amazing how hemingway's characters always manage to fall in love faster than it takes one to finish smoking a cigarette?) the story follows robert jordon's preparations for the attack and his relationship with maria and the guerrilla fighters who will assist him with the attack.

i am fairly puzzled by this novel, which is considered by many to be hemingway's best. it offers brilliant observations into the mind of his solider and the psychological aspects of participating in war and how jordon copes with the hardships of it. while reading some parts of this novel, i was fully absorbed and captivated. in others, i felt it was rather long-winded. perhaps some editing would have been handy. although i don't think it is hemingway's best, i do recommend it to hemingway's fans.",not my favorite hemingway,1372982400,A1DKMAQDFN0UWA,Erez Davidi

i urge everyone to pick up hemingway's complete short stories. those are really his best work and i have read all 500 or 600 pages twice. that is how brilliant and fascinating the stories are. they never get old, there are endless lessons about sadness, life, loss in those short stories that any generation can relate to. he simply masterfully sums up in less words what it would take most writers much longer to express. as a matter of fact, they would not be able to express them in nearly the same way.

2911,2,"this book has great passages, as other reviewers have pointed out, like pilar's tale or el  sordo's last stand, but is otherwise too long. it has three major flaws:

1. the hero's love interest, maria, is a uninteresting and unattractive. most of the other characters feel like flesh-and-blood, flawed people, but, for reasons i can't fathom, the author gave maria the psychological depth of a pet.
2. the hero's dialogs with spaniards are in a distracting and ridiculous form, resulting in lines like ""eatest thou always onions for breakfast?""
3. the characters' swearing is clumsily bleeped out, with lines like ""obscenity thy mother!"" at first, i thought  that the kindle edition i was reading had been censored, and returned it. i switched to scribner's 1968 print edition, and found the same. i cannot believe that hemingway actually wrote that way.

another strange passage that is also dating the book is one where the hero views himself as ""taking part in a crusade,"" adding ""that was the only word for it although it was a word that had been so worn and abused that it no longer gave its true meaning."" and what exactly is the true meaning of ""crusade""? historians have long known that crusaders were nothing but thugs rampaging through the middle-east. even voltaire wrote about it in the mid 18th century;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-crusades-through-arab-eyes/dp/0805208984/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">the crusades through arab eyes</a>, 23 years ago. yet europeans and americans have, until recently, used the crusades as a symbol of a generous and benevolent undertaking. even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crusade-in-europe/dp/080185668x/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">crusade in europe</a>referred to the liberation of europe as a ""crusade.""","good passages, but not hemingway's masterpiece",1342915200,AIHVWL83LN90U,Michel Baudin

but that amaturish style wasn't what turned me off of the book.  it was the horrible love story.  i'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys, but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic, but also stupid and insulting to women.  i was curious how this horrible love story would end, so then i read the last 20 pages of the book.  the ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning.

this book was not only not insightful about human nature, it actually ran counter to human nature.

2955,2,"i picked this book up a day after reading catch-22, perhaps the most drawn out, most asinine ridiculous over rated book ever written, and for whom the bell tolls is the second.

i found this novel silly, a glorified, and tamed sex novel one might find at the grocery store.  the love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this ""thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh"" garbage?  it took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.

this novel wasn't all bad, which is more than i can say for catch number 2 (that was not an error).  the three action packed scenes (the murder of the ""fascists"" at pablo's town, sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining.  these were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest.  i did a little research on hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, i feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.

oh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this ""now, all now, and now i say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have"" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the ""nows"" then there was the direct translation of spanish.  what was that all about?  ""less bad""?  that's ""menos mal"", which means literally less bad, but in english it sounds stupid.  it's different when you read this book and are fluent in spanish you see why the english is not less bad but all bad.  and what of the thees and thous?  and nays?  i get it, they were speaking archaic spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now i have to feel like i'm reading a 15th century novel.  the whole robert jordan thing was also annoying, just call him bob or robert or jordan.  lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?  the book is supposed to be about the death of idealism, but i saw none of that.",i didn't give it one star because...,1233187200,A2ZRJ9GMVL1K8I,S.

2958,4,"note that this review is for the audio book version of this novel.  the narrator was campell scott.  the audio quality was excellent and the narrator did a good job; he spoke with a slight spanish accent, which seemed to fit well with the narrative.  he did some characterizations with his voice, but not much compared to other narrators i've listened to.

this is the second time that i have read this novel; the first time was over 30 years ago in high school.  it's amazing to me how differently i looked at this book this time around.  the first time i read it; i saw it as an adventure story with some interesting character development.  the second time around i read it as a fascinating look at how war brings out the best and worst in people.

i feel that hemingway accurately captured how certain people would act in a civil war; the cruelty by some and acts of courage by others.  in all cases, the characters were in a situation where there were no great options.  he also accurately showed that there are good people on both sides of a conflict; that soldiers do suffer by taking the lives of others.

as a spanish speaker; i enjoyed hemingway's use of language.  most of the unique use of english is actually a direct literal translation of spanish.  i hadn't heard the phrases directly translated that way before, but immediately recognized them as common spanish slang.

2963,5,"hemingway's novel ""for whom the bell tolls"" (1940) is toughly realistic in its depiction of the butchery of warfare.  the book has the no-nonsense, fact-intensive style of a reporter. yet, in its themes of love, death, heroism, and human brotherhood, hemingway's novel is, in spite of itself, romantic in outlook, but romantic with an edge.

the novel is set in spain in 1937 during the spanish civil war (1936-1939).  the spanish civil war was a multi-sided conflict between the democratically-elected government, the republicans or loyalists, and its right-wing anti-communist opponents, the nationalists (fascists). the republicans during this conflict had the assistance of the ussr.  their enemies, the nationalists, were assisted by nazi germany and by italy. hemingway was a correspondent in spain at the time.  his novel tells the story of robert jordan, a young american instructor in spanish at the university of montana who had earlier spent much time wandering through spain. in 1936, with the outset of the conflict, jordan volunteered his services to assist the republicans and became an expert in explosives. jordan idealizes his grandfather who had been a hero in the american civil war.  jordan's father had committed suicide.  when the novel opens, jordan is assigned to destroy a bridge in furtherance of a republican offensive. he works with a group of guerrillas in the mountains.

the story unfolds over a time of three days. hemingway's book offers portrayals of a group of jordan's spanish compatriots, in addition to jordan himself.  chief among them is a 48-year old woman, pilar, physically unattractive, earthy, and strong-willed.  she is the de facto leader of her group and is as central to the story as is jordan. pilar is the ""woman"" of pablo, who was once a formidable fighter but who has become disillusioned by the conflict.  the novel includes several scenes of high tension and near violence between jordan and pablo. in his efforts to blow-up the bridge, jordan is assisted by anselmo, an aged man who despairs of violence and killing but is devoted to the republican cause.  and, in the three days of the novel, jordan meets and has a passionate love affair with maria, a lovely 19-year old who has been saved from the nationalists by pablo.

hemingway is known for a terse, elliptical writing style, and it is on display in this book.  but the writing is highly varied, with long stream of conscious digressions by jordan as he reflects upon his past life and upon the conflict in which he has thrust himself. much of the writing is both figurative and digressive. hemingway tried to transcribe much of spanish idiom directly into english, particularly the use of ""thou"" for the intimate spanish ""you."" he also makes considerable use of untranslated spanish phrases. the book captures the speech patterns of soldiers under tension, with much use of colorful language.  hemingway does not reproduce this language directly but, in english, uses phrases such as ""obscenity"" or ""unprintable"" in place of the words themselves.  in addition to telling the story of the bridge and its destruction, all the characters engage in long discussions of their thoughts and their prior lives.  these discussions generally are directed to the brutality of the war.  in an outstanding passage, pilar tells of the destruction under the command of pablo of a group of fascist leaders who are forced to run the gauntlet before being thrown down a cliff.

hemingway was in love with spain, both for its beauty and its brutality.  the novel has many discussions of bullfighting, largely told by pilar as she recounts her experiences with earlier lovers.  pilar also has a power of clairvoyance in the story, especially as it relates to impending death.  the book includes several vivid battle scenes. one of these scenes tells of the gunning-down by aircraft of a group of five of the guerillas assisting jordan at the top of a small hill.(aircraft has a large and fearsome presence in the book.) another effective battle scene tells of the difficult destruction of the bridge and its aftermath.

the love relationship between robert jordan and maria comes to dominate the novel. the two become passionately attracted to each other and quickly consummate their relationship.  the passages describing the couple's lovemaking are central to the story and effective. the inhumanity of war is juxtaposed against human commitment and the beauty of the everyday. robert jordan realizes that he is in love with maria, spain, and with life. this love, in the book, reaches its peak in heroism and self-sacrifice.  jordan comes to realize what in life he values.  it is because of his realization, that he ultimately must give up the things he comes to cherish.  within its language of toughness and machismo, this novel has the theme of inevitability and of romantic tragedy.

this is a book i read in high school many years ago when it was far beyond me. it is not an easy book, and not every part of it is successful. but it is an extraordinary novel. i am grateful that i had the opportunity to revisit the book when i was able to try to appreciate it.

2964,3,"i began reading for whom the bell tolls directly after finishing a particularly bad modern novel. at first, for whom... was a breath of fresh air: no long, run-on sentences; no excessive adverbs in the dialog tags; not a whole lot of meaningless adjectives, etc. the dialog was crisp and terse and enjoyable, and the setting was captivating.

but then... nothing happens. for a really long time. and all of the flashbacks via thought and story start to get confusing. at times, i wasn't sure if the story was in the present or past; in the thoughts of the protagonist or the speech of another character. and speaking of characters, four of them are strong and compelling: robert jordan (the protagonist), maria (his love interest), pilar (a tough old woman), and pablo (a once-great but now tarnished soldier). a fifth character of note is the gypsy, but the other characters in this ensemble cast are largely indistinguishable from one another.

one more criticism: i was really hoping to get a better understanding of the spanish civil war and its politics. maybe i did. but robert jordan and his cadre are not hardline communists nor anarchists (they have special contempt for the latter) but ""republicans"" in their fight against the fascists. not a lot of background is given as to the roots of this conflict or the underlying motivations of each camp.

overall, i feel i have been enriched by reading this book, and i like hemingway's writing style (this is my first hemingway since reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-old-man-and-the-sea/dp/0743564367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">the old man and the sea</a>&nbsp;in 9th grade), but all in all, i understand why this has been called one of the ""10 books not to read in your lifetime."" also: did i have an edited version? what was with all of this ""i 'obscenity' in your milk,"" etc.?",stylistically superb but lacking in action and thin on the background of the spanish civil war,1225497600,A3F00QUIXGDTOW,Dawn-Marie

2972,4,"hemingway is a master storyteller, and for whom the bell tolls is a fine example of that mastery. the strengths lie in character development, and thematic presentation. the weaknesses lie in it's style, and language. for example, the use of what passes for colloquial spanish, particularly in it's profane form, seems artificial and clumsy. i also think elements of the plot tend to weaken or dilute the overall effect of the climax, like when pilar reads jordan's palm to tell his future, thus foreshadowing events to come.

that being said, this is a very inspirational book, and hemingway has a knack for grabbing the reader's attention, and keeping it. he is especially good in his short fiction, and an excellent example of that can be found within this novel, when pilar tells the tale of her village. it is perhaps,the single most riveting and effective part of the novel.

for whom the bell tolls is of course one of the great novels to deal with sacrifice for righteous causes, and devotion to higher ideals. it reminds me, in a way, of a tale of two cities, in that respect. it is a great noble work, and an indictment of war. there is also a great personal love story here. hemingway writes (maybe intentionally) very cinematic novels.",inspirational despite some flaws,1205366400,A57JIBFWM3L0H,JfromJersey

this was my first hemingway, i finished it just recently, and man is he overrated.  there are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.

unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story.  i loved the characters, i was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through i realized that i was forcing myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.

hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith i suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word ""now"" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.

so after experiencing hemingway i can honestly say that i won't be going back, and i can only envy his success.",350 pages of pretentiousness -- 150 pages of great fiction,1198627200,A3EYOITBD7ZXOV,BruceWayne
2979,2,"the spanish civil war was surely the most brutal and tragic civil war of the twentieth century. it not only pitted spaniard against spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for world war ii, with nazi germany and mussolini's italy lining up on the side of franco's insurgents and the ussr backing the embattled left-leaning republic. (the western democracies - who might have prevented spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous ""hands off"" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. they were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless realpolitik.

so with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. if you were an author trying to write the great spanish civil war novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-spanish?

500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. it turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. to have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the spanish civil war and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. from this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?

the prose is the next problem. much has been made of hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. however, i found it impossible to read ""for whom the bells tolls"" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. consider the following extracts [from the vintage edition]:

a hole in a hillside is described as:

""both deep and profound""
[p. 444]

characters exchange such dialogue as:

'well, then. oh, then. oh, then. oh.'
[p. 166]

'maria.'
'yes.'
'maria.'
'yes.'
'maria.'
'oh, yes. please.'
[p. 272]

'but use thy head. thou hast much head. use it.'
[p. 444]

which brings us to the hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:

""in an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. you try to last out until night to get back in. you are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.""
[p.  174]

""so a woman like that pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? yes, what happens? what happens? you tell me what happens, please. that is just what happens. that is exactly what happens.""
[p.  175]

followed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (how many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)

my favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to joaqu&iacute;n that la pasionara has a son in russia. instead of naming the character, hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:
""'if we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to joaqu&iacute;n about la pasionara's son in russia asked.""
[p. 324]

on and on it goes like this. for three days. in a cave. this book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (""... the flakes was dropping diagonally ..."" [p. 185]; ""... and then brining it down ..."" [p. 213]; ""... the felling when the ingl&eacute;s gave the order ..."" [p. 380]; at one point andr&eacute; marty is referred to as ""mary"" [p. 437]).

so it needs to be said openly. hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of nobel laureates.",lazy and messy,1188950400,A1PN3R8DXRQ1C3,G M

2998,1,"i normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic american literature.  however, hemingway's english translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that i could not get past them.  the use of ""thy"" and ""thou"" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century english.  quoting the characters as asking, ""how do you call yourself?"" instead of ""what is your name?"" is downright silly.  if hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  regardless, who needs a literal translation?  how is ""how do you call yourself"" better than ""what is your name""?  and is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern english?  i found these ""translations"" so distracting from what was going on that i couldn't continue past chapter 2.  i get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak spanish.",terrible if you speak spanish,1152489600,A3F7WHZDCEMHQZ,YOLO Matty
3000,2,"i found this book, which takes place during the spanish civil war, interesting in its descriptions and although it is excruciatingly slow in its development (five hundred pages detailing three days worth of events), somewhat compelling in its own way.

and yet in the end, ""for whom the bell tolls"" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. to me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.

for example, one would assume that robert jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what hemingway deems heroic. like hemingway, jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and hemingway's fascination with spain and dislike for the spanish fascist. but yet, one has to wonder what compels jordan, an american college professor from montana, to be involved in this spanish civil war to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. what busness, really and truly, is this war of his?

further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, communists that hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the fascists?

notable is the fact that the jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as hemingway's own father did. and for hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.

this book demonstrates that hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. for example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the spanish language is rather clever. however, as the story progresses, hemingway's usage of the king james-style ""thee"" and ""thou"" to indicate that a more formal spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. at least, it did for me.

this is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned god and godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. what little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. the trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who jordan - as hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. rather contradictory, i would say. and jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.

3001,1,"i hate not finishing a book that i've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, i had no qualms whatsoever. the characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-d maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please robert jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. i thought that anna karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. it was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. and it doesn't even really paint the spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""la lengua de los mariposas"" or ""butterfly"" in english, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. this book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--i'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of rj, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences i've ever seen (anyone who tells you that hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).

in short, this book is not worth your time--read one of hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.",worst book i've ever read,1151280000,A3MC2Z7VQOM8B3,Sherrilina
3016,3,"according to the book's jacket, 'for whom the bell tolls' is hemingway's finest novel.  i disagree.  while the book does a fine job of describing the life of a partisan, its 490 pages only cover a few days' time.  so, don't expect a lot of fast-moving action.  this novel is basically a character study of the different persons in american volunteer robert jordan's hosting partisan band.  therefore, if you enjoy character studies then you will indeed enjoy this book.

the plot is that jordan is sent to blow up a bridge in the spanish hinterland.  he is to contact a local partisan band and secure their assistance in helping him destroy the bridge.  once he arrives at the band's secret refuge internal power struggles immediately begin as jordan's mission will endanger the survival of all the band's members.  in addition, there is the inevitable romantic subplot between jordan and the mysterious maria.

utilizing the flashback as a vehicle, hemingway defines each actor's traumatic personal history, his/her decisions, and his character.  jordan the idealistic young american university professor becomes the daring, charismatic, and ideologically indifferent demolitions expert.  pablo the angry peasant becomes the murderous, avaricious guerilla leader.  pilar the ugly yet happy wife of a diminutive bullfighter is widowed and becomes the overbearing, honorable wife of pablo.  maria the fragile, innocent virgin becomes the emotionally-scarred, vulnerable lover of jordan.  anselmo the venerable old peasant becomes the determined, brave guerilla fighter.  and so it goes with many of the other book's characters.

the book is a good character study and portrait of life as a spanish partisan, but i found it to be much too slow moving for my taste.  this is decent novel, but it's not really a war novel.  in my opinion, farewell to arms is a much better war novel and is hemingways's best book.",a few days with partisans in the spanish civil war,1113868800,A90KKMU3KV9HO,George Coppedge
3029,5,"evocative, tragic, brutal, bitter. using the spanish civil war of the 1930s as his backdrop, hemmingway critiques warfare from the political abstractions and distant generals to the individual lives it destroys, and renders all in frighteningly powerful detail with every crosscurrent coming to bear on each character in ways that are viscerally wrenching, complex and yet clear. every shade of character and dynamic is captured as several dozen people act out a small part in a large conflict in the two-and-a-half days of a mission to blow a bridge.
robert jordan, an american in the volunteer brigades, arrives deep in the mountain wilderness of spain with orders to recruit and employ the services of irregular militia hiding out there in the vicinity of a small bridge that will be key to an impending offensive. his task requires that he win the hearts and minds of these locals in order to secure their loyalty so that he might have an effective small force for carrying out his mission. but this group of people are of conflicting feelings and understandings about their place in the conflict and what it means to each of them. some are wary and some callous, some dedicated to the fight and others only dedicated to themselves.
we have real people-anselmo's natural and true goodness, pilar and el sordo's dedication, pablo's treachery, maria's repeated loss of innocence. we have the politics and forces behind it all-selfish and hollow, or abstracted until it's no longer human. and we have warfare-sudden death, alone in the mountains, alone with your last thoughts, with the smell of burning flesh, with your last blood running silently into the dirt.
hemmingway spares us the simplistic narrative style of describing each character's feelings. instead, he offers the scenes themselves with such insightful observation and flawlessly rendered detail that every one of the many conflicting shifts of allegiance happening in pablo's scheming mind is writ in his every gesture and expression and telling silence. neither the characters nor the narrator ever need discuss these in so many words. the tensions among the characters as they huddle in their cave hideout are a fascinating web of unexpected assessments of each other, shifts of power and influence, tactical and strategic wins and loses. though never spoken of, the delicacy and danger of jordan's human task is clear. as a contrast there is maria, at first seeming too childish until we realize jordan's love for her is love for lost innocence, and that she in turn-only seventeen-has every right to her emotional fragility and her desperation.
and then there is the war itself, and here again hemmingway's powers of observation and prose composition startle. every action bears on every other, and the individuals are placed firmly in context from the cave to the local mountains to the whole of spain to the abstractions of global political movements. without a syllable of pedantry the author draws the relationship between each detail of individual action and the whole of the conflict. and vice versa, with ideals or their absence making each person's motives a little different, and often making helpless puppets of them all.
there is very little in literature to compare with for whom the bell tolls. it sees humanity at its very best and very worst simultaneously, and sees it directly in vivid, glimmering images and beautifully textured emotional nuance, without wordy narrative telling the reader what to think and when. the fact that hemmingway yet controls our understanding with absolute ease and clarity is only half of the writer's art. his critique of warfare and its human toll, expressed in jordan's arc of hope and tragedy and resignation, is as brutal as the fear and blood on the ground, and ultimately contemplates the interconnectedness of life and the sacrifices made to sustain it.

3072,2,"i've read two other previous books by hemingway.  feel free to read those  reviews as well.  in his best piece, old man and the sea, hemingway  describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between  and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin).  in  another book, the sun also rises, hemingway paints a very rich and colorful  portraitt of spain and pamplona that i could not sum up in a few sentences.  both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.
this  book, however, does nothing of the sort.  excluding a side story that  concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and  provides little insight.  the majority of this 450 page book takes place in  one cave and provides very little substance.  personally, no picture was  painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning  came from this book.
i grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation  about killing the guerilla leader pablo, and bored of the lightweight,  unreal romance.  an editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the  book would have not missed a beat.

to add insult to injury, robin creates a fantastical frame for his book, purveying the conceit that these are all ancient principles transmitted by a group of himalayan monks who live remote, pure lives. instead, they sound more like good resolutions that one makes at the start of each new year, to be forgotten as each day drags us down with its myriad of challenges and one can't even keep off that extra chocolate cake let alone transmogrify into superior beings capable of earning the millions that the writer makes telling us how to be good.",the most glittering gold paper,1500508800,A1YP8Z1A29E9LZ,Alex Soong

in his book, robin tries to communicate 7 different virtues that can help elevate a person's way of living. he does this via a monk who was a successful lawyer in his previoua life who got burnt out. the main story is based on a creative visual of a beauttiful garden that robin put in place to help the reader parse the 7 virtues. i did find the narrative a bit 'backwards', in the sense that robin seems to have worked backwards from the idea of this garden and forced the narrative. i also found it a little funny that the junior mawyer, who the monk was talking to throughout the story, seemed a lot more naive about life than you'd expect :-).

overall, robin does present some provocative thoughts that are worth considering and great one liner quites that stuck with me. as a result i am rating this book as a 4 star!",good book that may inspire actions in my daily life,1477612800,A1AF16SGDAHJDK,Amazon Customer

i read this and other brambly hedge books to my kids who are 6 and 4 and they adore them, sitting quietly, listening intently through the book.  my 6 year old reads this book as well with some help from me. vocabulary is hard in this story but the fact that it introduces new words not ordinarily seen in modern books is a bonus.

3194,2,"i admire the effort and the ideas, but i find this book tough to get through.  the story uses cliches an average of every third sentence throughout the book.  the writing had zero subtext, like the script of an after-school special. nearly every sentence of dialog ends with something like ""...he said mischievously"", ""...i added thoughtfully"", ""...he whispered somberly"", ""...i blurted excitedly"". it wore on me after a while.

i think self-improvement ""fable"" books can work well, if they are well-written.  who moved my cheese and the go giver are written as stories and provide valuable lessons that i remember years after reading the book.  i think this book attempts that but doesn't succeed.  i read this book a few days ago and the lessons are already fading from memory. here's the main point: take time to reflect, live your priorities, don't work too hard.  all the lessons are unoriginal and re-hashed, which admittedly is the case for nearly all self-improvement books.  however, if a book is going to remind me of concepts that are already well-known, i want it to be done in a way that keeps my interest more.

i'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because what i do admire is that the author was clearly not a trained writer when we wrote the book, yet he wrote it anyway and lots of people have read it and liked it.  that's a useful credential to have as someone who teaches how to identify and follow your dreams.  i'm guessing he pushed past a comfort zone (as he teaches) and did something that was important to him.

the best part: when they climb over a giant, sleeping, naked bear. that would be equivalent to climbing over a large, sleeping naked man in their world. it's just a weird thing to do. and it reveals the whole exercise as home invasion.

3308,3,"i confess that i have somewhat mixed feelings about this book. i read it on holiday and began by expecting and hoping to read an insightful story. for the first few pages this seemed to be the case, however the book then changed direction.

in many ways the author of a book designed to help people change, what are often termed `self-help' books, faces a dilemma. for the help to be successful it has to be self-help, that is it has to come from within the reader. the use of stories or parables that awaken understanding in the reader derive their power in this way. however after reading the story the reader is then left with the question of what to do with this awakened understanding; how do they actually change?

the alternative approach is to provide a change instruction manual which prescribes changes in the hope that these then create change from which new understanding will follow. the danger here is that unless understanding is changed, the result is the mindless application of prescribed rituals, or the rejection of them.

this book attempts to bridge these two approaches. it begins with the story of a lawyer forced to re-evaluate life following a major heart attack. however this story quickly becomes a rather simple framework for what is largely a monologue describing a set of self-change techniques.

at the point where the book transitions from a story to an instruction guide i almost gave up on the book, but was later glad that i didn't. i found the pretext of the story strained almost to breaking point, but suggest that if this is overlooked the second half of the book contains some powerful advice for personal change. i did have the feeling of ideas collected together from elsewhere, but amongst them is a structure of practical changes that have the potential to profoundly change your outlook and achievements.

the measure of value of any such instruction guide rests not in what the reader is instructed to do, but in what the reader does with the advice. for my part, a little surprisingly, i have taken a number of the change suggestions and am applying them. the book therefore has had a greater impact than many.",lessons on change.,1315008000,A1KQ06BYIZGG4A,Steven Unwin

the parable is a little facile, and the dialog naive-- but the overall thrust benign and even helpful. it may well be a doorway to a better path for many who read it. if you've never encountered eastern philosophy before but are already a fan of corporate pep talks, you may find this a real treat.",an odd blend...,1214006400,A1XSHZULVUAEFU,Steve Aelfcyning

there is not much in the way of a plot, and the story is the interaction between a high profile trial lawyer and his protoge.  you would expect this pair to not only be highly intelligent, but highly articulate as well.  the simple and trite dialog between the two just did not seem realistic to me.  the story and it's characters seemed shallow.

in terms of enlightenment the book presents 7 steps to live a wonderful life.  i found the parable given to be silly, but the 7 steps are good stuff.  they came off as lacking depth to me though, probably because the story was not good enough to draw me in.

douglas coupland was born 12-30-1962 on a canadian nato base in west germany, then grew up and lives in vancouver canada. he wrote other books. this novel is based on the lives of microsoft workers who work long hours programming the software that makes personal computer hardware respond to customer commands. using fiction means never having to use footnotes yet still present a picture of computer workers and their lives. this 1995 book has seven chapters on its 371 pages. it begins in the fall of 1993 and ends in january 1995. it tells about other events in that era. it is like a web log that records daily activity but does not go into details about daniels work. does this story tell something about it author? does this book have any value for most people? no, i would advise a good murder mystery.

daniels father suffers from a cutback at work. [every expandingbusiness reaches a plateau then a reduction in force.] his younger brother jed in a swimming accident years earlier. [no details about this although dan was present.] the story tells about their work pressures and schedules, their choices in diet, etc. the expect to be burned out or retired by age fifty. then they hope to live in luxury (as long as their stock in microsoft pays off). you can read between the lines to understand their work environment. what if their jobs are outsourced to a foreign country? do they have a viable plan b? would forming a trade union help?

by chapter 2 it become weary - those pages with large type for random words. daniel earned $26k a year; was that a fair wage for a sixty-hour week? he was a tester not a programmer. this is just as important even if a lower skill set. the designer is the most important, like the writer of the script for a movie. all depend on a financier to provide funding. they work on games, a non-productive use of resources that entertains and doesnt educate. is america running out of telephone numbers (p. 79)? was this due to poor design (the use of 0 or 1 for area codes? the importance of lego is the correlation to an age level and a preference to constructing a whole from simple parts. remember lincoln logs? or is that like ibm hollerith cards?

there is more padding (pp. 104-105). daniel and his friends migrate to california for a new business opportunity (chapter 3). the differences are noted. [this is before the current drought.] are its referenced dated like slang from the 1940s? george orwells novel 1984 warned against the thought control of big business. one example is the foolish talk about clothing stores in chapter 5, they are oblivious to their brain-washing! chapter 7 seems to be tacked on for its sensationalism. it ends with a sudden attack of sickness, then sentimental feelings. will their product be a success? for what length of time? eventually the users will drop it for another toy. what is more fickle than fashion, and those who profit from creating changing tastes?",a parody of computer workers?,1428537600,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,Acute Observer

3478,3,"though the journal-entry style of this book is refreshing when compared to other fiction books masquerading as reality, i find it hard to discern anything more than the generic ramblings of twenty-somethings in the hi-tech industry.  they talk about completely random things, such as what programs pet animals would write if they could.  each character also voices their personal opinions on the purpose of life throughout the book.  these odd bunch of friends start their ""lives"" (in the real world) influenced by the microsoft-cult-culture.  their lives revolve around work (usually past midnight and even on weekends) and sleep (they all live in the same house close to ""campus"").  naturally an event such as a close-friend's proposal to start up a new company and recruit them as ""equity partners"" (aka employees) throws them off balance and threatens the humdrum existence and pseudo-harmony they've come to expect as employees in building seven on the microsoft campus.  that's where the adventure begins for these people.  moving from redmond to silicon valley, they set up shop in daniel's parents' home in the valley.  from here, the book turns into a coming out party of sorts.  dan's dad is having a midlife crisis after having been laid off by ibm.  bug comes out of the closet.  dusty gets pregnant.  michael falls in love.  all these happen while they're trying to come out with a product they can showcase in the consumer electronics show in vegas.
this book is unnerving in some sense.  it is able to accurately capture what many people in the hi-tech industry are like -- their habits, propensities, worries and fears (even their ""language"").  but it falls short in certain aspects.  the storytelling was at times uncoherent and lacked a fluid story-telling aspect.  it got too bogged down with the philosophizing.  and at times, it felt like writing for the sake of writing.  i particularly disliked the ending however poignant.  my thoughts as i finished the final pages were ""that's not fair to the reader!""  i was referring to the whammy of dan's family tragedy.  i couldn't find any reason as to why that was added except to reinforce the randomness and cest la vie attitude of this book.
this book is so random.  if you like to read what ""geeks"" have in their minds, then this book is for you.  if you prefer to read a story with a real plot about what the dot-com world is like, i would highly recommend startup by jerry kaplan instead.",ramblings...,1015027200,A15S44J4NHU4LS,Alvin Tanhehco

written as a diary, it follows a programmer for microsoft who uproots with his group house gang and moves to the bay area.  you'll get a lot of musing about cars favored in seattle vs. the bay area as well as the gap.  costco is prominent, as are legos, the mac, etc.  the book should be loads of fun.  even lots of star trek references. but it just doesn't ring true, either technically or in terms of the vc-driven world of startups.
if you want a good book of fiction on programmers, check out neal stephenson's cryptonomicon.  if you want pop references, read anything by stephen king.  if you want silicon valley hype and stories about venture capitalists, read michael lewis's non-fiction new new thing.  if you want to read about marketing high tech, read gordon moore's non-fiction crossing the chasm.

douglas coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the x generation can understand and relate to. heck he must be the expert since he coined the term ""generation x"". however, he also must appeal to the me me me it's all about me self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. i recognise that this is a generalisation, and i am not condemning coupland nor his fans. i am simply saying that coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. i read his earlier works, and i enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time i find that he tries too hard. what i mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. for example, in microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the uwajimaya on 156th in bellevue. locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater bellevue/redmond/eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that uwajimaya is really on 156th in bellevue. the problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is clever and what is trying too hard. maybe just uwajimaya in bellevue or uwajimaya on 156th. either/or but not both! just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded kingdome) and local ""things"" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. i know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but i found it, once again, artificial.
coupland writes microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how gen x parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. gen xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. interestingly, most of what technical talk coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for microsoft. most of coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most microsofties read it and like it. however, when all the employees move to the bay area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence.
the narrator, dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the ""information superhighway"" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. he notes that only foreign employees at microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a west coast american concept. later in the book, the observations deteriorate to dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are ""decadent"" or karla and other characters discussing how their barbie dolls had sex lives.
yes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of microsoft and can be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable. is it great? is it a classic? no. it can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.","yes, well, you geeks are an odd blend of doors and brakes.",992131200,A84UFSF2SZS2W,EriKa

the mystery serves up the standard lot of suspects and while the endings are never too much of a surprise, the process of getting there is satisfying for history buffs. as seems to be the case for most goddard books, hand in glove starts off strong and then weakens in the final third of the story....i'm not sure if that is because he tries to string the story out too long (his books average 600 pages or so) or if he just loses interest as the goes, but it seems to be a pattern for his books.  the strength of the first portions of the stories, however, make them worthwhile reads. i'll certainly read more of his novels, but suggest them as a library read.",mysteries based in the past,1341705600,AEV9CT81N33CR,M.Jacobsen
3531,2,"robert goddard is an author i expect more of.
in hand in glove an entire family seems to have never taken the time to get to know each other while disdaining to develop friends, interests or relationships other than those predetermined by biology. this in itself would be an interesting tale told by another sort of author--along the lines of william trevor. however, when an entire book is based on a premise that the expiring royalties from two very slender volumes of poetry are enough to incite murder and kidnapping in this same clan--whose daily expenditures seem more in the realm of rupert murdoch/richard branson--the plot wheezes improbably along until at long last resorting to a rapid, highly improbable and sensational tabloid-style conclusion.
i liked goddard's ""found wanting"" very much, written c. 2008, so perhaps ""hand in glove"" c. 1992 is just an early and less accomplished effort and i simply expected more by reading chronologically out of order.",implausible tale of willful ignorance and murder,1313452800,A1TXC96UFDM22J,E.

3533,3,"i must admit i was surprised to find goddard's works available in the us. i would not have thought they were an american reader's cup of tea!

anyway, i have become so disappointing with his works in recent years that if i feel like a fix of his tortured plots i now just read some of his first books.

this novel was first published in 1992. it has all the usual elements - a mystery from a few generations back that envelop surviving relatives, an international dimension that brings in foreign travel*, a bringing together of unlikely characters who usually start out as enemies and become friends and a cast from goddard's version of central casting which includes the usual weak hero or heroine, cardboard bad guys and assorted bit players.

this basic plot worked for a while in books like ""into the blue"", ""borrowed time"", ""take no farewell"" and to an extent ""hand in glove"" and then fizzled out.

that may sound like a rather cynical account of goddard's works but it is based on my reading of almost everything he has written.

so if you are new to goddard, choose these earlier works and avoid his later books.

the basis of this story - the murder of the sister of an english poet who died during the spanish civil war allegedly to obtain the copyright on his poems - is unconvincing.

of course, there is a greater mystery afoot and goddard unravels it via trips to various parts of southern england, wales, the united states, france and spain. it is a reasonable read but be prepared for stilted dialogue, one-dimensional characters and a roller coaster ride.

3576,3,"this book seems like a rambling diary of author's research  for a piece he did for the ny times magazine millennium issue. the history and connections he presents are sometimes quite interesting, but it seems his notes needed a lot more editing and illustration.

for example, the division of material into chapters seems arbitrary and not particularly helpful. the narrative is choppy in many parts. one is not sure where he is going with his assorted findings of references to screws through the ages. he jumps around, back and forth, delving in the 1700's, then the middle ages, then the 1800's, then roman times, then to the 1500's...it's quite confusing to follow the thread, if there is one. i don't think the author took the time to reflect on all he had found and tell a clear story of it. rather he revels (understandably) in the fun and frustrations of researching the material.

his assertion that the inventor of the screw was clearly a mathematical genius is not very convincing. yes, the helix is elegant. but as his evidence makes clear, the screw probably started out as an ancient, very simple and crude tool and evolved from there. just because some mathematicians like hero describe it mathematically doesn't mean he invented it. it may not even be accurate to say the screw was invented--after all the shape of the screw is found in nature. there is just a history of increasingly inventive and optimized uses of its shape.

the author did provide enough information for me to observe that that the evolution of using screws seems to have gone through three main phases:

in the first phase it was used as the primary part of a large tool, such as a method of moving water or lifting heavy objects. they were often crude and made out of basic natural materials.

the second phase saw screws being made smaller and being integrated, not as fastners, but as parts of more complex tools, such as lathes, as well as toys, weapons and watches, where the screw help proper other parts. these required more precise screws made of separately manufactured materials, such as metal alloys.

the third phase saw screws being used not to move things, but as as stationary fasteners. here it would have been particularly interesting to read more about why manufactuers chose to use screws vs. rivets, nails or other fasteners depending on the different applications and materials to be fastened. but the autor does an interesting job exploring the evolution of screw head types, such as flat-head, phillips and square socket. also, once screws began to be used as fastners the challenge of manufacturing them seemed to go from inventing ways to make them smaller, more precise and more durable, to manufacturing them faster to feed ever-increasing numbers of assembly lines, construction workers, handymen, craftsmen, hobbyists, and do-it-yourselfers.

one could also say that perhaps screws have entered yet another phase as being objects of art and history. the use of the term in english vocabularly has certainly evolved colorfully.

these phases overlap overtime and continue in tandem. in each of these phases, one could have logically sub-divided information about how they are used in each scenario (tool, part, fasteners, art, etc.), their specific design features, how they were made and out of what, how they were optimized for each use over time and famous examples of there use.

i would have liked to see better use of illustrations in the book. the few that were included could have been better placed. a timeline would have been very helpful. a richly illustrated introductory chapter exploring how screw-like features are found in nature (e.g., the helix, certain animal joints, etc.), would have been great. also, how wonderful it would have been to show a chart (perhaps on the inside covers) of all the diversity of screw heads and screw types that we now have side-by side, let alone illustrations of all the different kinds of tools for screwing and and removing screws.

so there are bits of the book that i found interesting, and others that i found frustrating. at best, i think the book is a hodge-podge of sometimes interesting trivia about the history of the screw. considering the author's point about how important the screw has been to enabling modern civilization, a more organized, analyzed and illustrated treatment would have been warranted. i can't imagine the author had a lot of time to spend on this project, but i wish he could have spent more.

all said, a mixed review is the best i can offer. your level of curiosity will determine how desirable a read it is.","interesting stuff, but a bit dry and disorganized.",1042934400,A3M1UDVBDX97NA,OpenMinded

3623,1,"i enjoy stories about past lives. i love good historical novels. i have some first hand experience with hypnotic regression. i usually love novels written 20-30 years ago. but not this one. it managed to annoy me on many levels.

one could excuse the repeated violent rape scenes, including one perpetrated by the hero, as being characteristic of the 1980s when this book was written, as that was a time before women had finally figured out that a man who says ""i love you"" and then perpetrates a violent rape belongs in prison, not in your bed.

one might even excuse as characteristic of the 1980s is the fact that all the protagonists in the story behave like alcoholics, downing what we now would consider volumes of drink that would be diagnosed as binge drinking in just about every scene set in the present.

but one one cannot excuse the ridiculous way in which hypnosis and past life regression are presented in this story and the silly way that everyone including supposed medical professionals encourage what would be in real life a psychotic reaction in the heroine.

the heroine herself is too stupid to live--the classic dumb heroine who, when warned not to go down into the darkened basement while a killer is on the loose and the power is out, always goes into the basement. if you enjoy that kind of story you'll love this one. if you like your heroine to be slightly brighter than a guinea pig, save your 99 cents and download something else.

the worst part of this book is that the writer has enough of a command of style to get you reading this bloated, endlessly long book. so that it isn't until you've gotten more than half way through that you realize just how stupid the plotting is. if you keep reading after that you are rewarded with a completely unbelievable and emotionally unsatisfied ending.

further complaints: the book claims that the history that lies behind the endlessly dull past-life story is well-researched, but any author who puts bubonic plague into a story set in the last decades of the 1100s has not done their research. even in the days before google mildly educated people knew that the plague first appeared in europe in 1348.

if the book had swept me into an emotionally moving story i would have easily overlooked the innaccuracies, but the emotional interaction between the main characters is wooden and we never get into their heads or feel their reactions, both in the story set in the present and the one in the past. both are static, with no character undergoing a hint of growth anywhere. the characters are the same on at the end (which felt like page 9000 by the time i got there) as they were in chapter 1. how this book got to be a bestseller in a world that produced outlander a few years later is beyond me.

perhaps you had to read it in 1985 to love it, since there do seem to be many readers who did. but reading it in 2012, i certainly didn't. between the rape scenes and the endless boring interactions between dull english people living what must have been considered a glamorous life in the mid-1980s this book struck me as one that should have remained a fond memory.",a colossal waste of time,1356912000,A21Y64R8N4FWHH,A Lover of Good Books

matilda's husband william is not really nice, king john feels he can do what he wants with her, and richard de clare is the only man who really loves and understand her. joanna has a life not to far away from matilda's as she has a group of men who think they know what is best for her but she is not married to any of them and jo is pretty head strong, but with each man thinking they know whats best for her she finds her self confused and overwhelmed and sometimes she has a hard time distinguishing between herself and matilda at times.

it was a interesting story about two different centuries, but two women who where a lot alike, although i don't really believe in reincarnation, past life stuff it was still a interesting story and if you like historical/modern storytelling then i think you would like this book.",decent book,1287964800,A12ZPJFWDG6S4P,Stormi @ BMReviewsohmy
3664,3,"""lady of hay"" was an interesting dive into the world of hypnosis and some would say, time travel.  the story uses the theory of hypnotic regression as well as the concept of reincarnation to support the plot.  i myself am not a believer in either of these psychological/spiritual ideas, so my approach to this novel was that of a time-travel fan.  i saw our main characters not as reincarnated, but as people whose minds seemed to be alternating from 1985 to the turn of the 12th century.  i'm sure this wasn't the author's intent, but it enabled me to enjoy the story.

joanna is a feisty young writer, researching the topic of hypnotic regression for an article that she's putting together for an english publication.  through her research, she finds that she seems to be inexplicably tied to matilda de st. valerie, born in 1160 ad and wed to william de braose in 1174.  other friends and associates in her life also seem to be linked to citizens of ancient england.  through hypnosis, the past and the present begin to intermingle, leading to life-or-death situations for some of the main characters.

originally released in 1986, ""lady of hay"" went on to sell over 3 million copies.  this is not surprising to me, as erskine weaves an interesting and compelling tale.  i enjoyed the frequent alternations between past and present, as well as the various struggles that characters went through in the different time periods.  there was suspense, romance, mystery, and a dynamic plot that pressed on with consistent energy until the conclusion.

as a non-believer of reincarnation, i wish the story could have been told in another way.  i think one motivation of using reincarnation is to give characters a chance to ""begin again"" and try to improve upon what has happened in a past life, even attempt to atone for mistakes they've made, especially with loved ones.  this is a central and driving need for all of us--the desire to be loved and to achieve a state of reconciliation or atonement.  as such, the reader can relate to the desires felt by the modern characters of jo, sam, nick and tim.  despite all the hardships they endured and/or perpetrated, in their souls they sought love and resolution.

because of my religious faith and some of the graphic and adult nature of some of this novel, i can't say that i would heartily recommend it to those who share my beliefs.  however, if you can look past the spiritual overtones and see it as a time-traveling adventure and a realistic depiction of how people lived & were treated 800 years ago, then you should enjoy lady of hay.  not all of it wraps up with a perfectly tied bow at the end, but the main conclusion is satisfying and the tale as a whole was an interesting experience.  if nothing else, it made me grateful for the beliefs i hold to be true (and not fiction) and for the husband i heartily enjoy in this singular life.

3672,1,"i am an avid reader of historical fiction, with the emphasis on the ""historical"" rather than the ""upthrust breast"" variety.  this catastrophe fails at both. i have read many many entries in this genre from the extraordinary to the putrid.  lady of hay falls somewhere below this last category.  as other readers have commented, this book is about 200 pages too long. the author has managed to confuse tedium with suspense by dragging out the conclusion long past the point of reader exhaustion.  ms. erskine's attempts to interweave the present day ""plot"" with historical narrative is a complete failure, as she only manages to disrupt both story lines resulting in a herky-jerky narrative flow that became quite annoying.  compounding the problem, not a single character is the slightest bit sympathetic, and although i began the read with curiosity and interest, i ended feeling frustrated and cheated.  there are many red herrings dropped along the way that kept me reading, but i got no satisfaction at the end.  why do we meet everyone's mother?  how many literary agents, photographers and editors need to be introduced by their names, only to drop from sight 20 pages later?  what about nurse jeanne's foreshadowing of matilda's illegitimate daughter ultimately giving her secret away resulting in calamity?  did i miss that scene as i waded through episode after repetitive episode of modern jo swooning in the rain as she ""channels"" lady matilda?  there are too many superfluous characters, seemingly all of whom are interested in and experienced with past life regression, who i kept expecting would have some role in the overall ""meaning"" of this morass, but they never did.  not to mention, most of the players seem good candidates for alcoholics anonymous.  i cannot recall another novel which features wine, ale, scotch, pimms and their ilk as the central focus in seemingly every scene.  the insane behavior of all principals appeared to be nothing more than the result of years of alcohol poisoning - a medieval lost weekend.  i became so exasperated with their antics and cruel misdeeds that i actually found myself rooting for them all to be sent to the pokey or a rehab facility.

this book was a major disappointment in every way.  it is short on history and long on artifice.  if there were some way to award negative stars, this is the ideal candidate.  save your money.",save your money!,1117065600,A2KALATI106D7J,Miranda Good
3673,2,"lady of hay makes a promising start. jo is a young journalist who researches past life regression for a magazine article. as research, she undergoes hypnosis and discovers that she is not only easily hypnotized (so easily that later in the book someone calls and hypnotizes her over the phone!) but in a previous life she was matilda de braose, a 12th century welshwoman. how exciting, i said to myself. this could be very fun. matilda is a real historical figure. i love historical fiction. i would enjoy the puzzle of matching past lives with present characters, and of course i hoped for romance. but alas...it was not to be.
the first half of the book was great.  it keeps up a good pace and intriguing events unfold as jo and her present life alternate with regressions to matilda's existence.  but by the second half of the book there is no new material and far too much repetition as well inexplicable violence against the main character that simply turned me off to her possible love interests. in the 1st half of the book we learn that 3 men love jo in both the past and the present and we know who they were in their past lives.  we also learn about the end of matilda's life very early in the story.  so where can the author take us from here?
i hoped that some of the modern day characters besides the 3 men would eventually be revealed to have some involvement in the past lives or a more important role in the present.  however, they don't.  i also expected that that the author might expand on history and offer an explanation for the legend of matilda building hay castle in one night.  she doesn't.  and i was disappointed with the mundane theory about rumors that matilda was a witch.  the explanation: she studied herb lore with her nurse jeanne and rides horses swiftly, like a man. but perhaps most disappointing of all is the fact that nick, the man she is in love with in the present was very cruel to her in her past life and not very nice to her in the present and there is no satisfactory explanation of why.  nor did it seem that his behavior was ever an obstacle to their relationship in the present.  and what about sam's behavior?  the actions of 2 of jo's lovers leaves me questioning how much if at all, they really care(d) for her.  richard was the one nice guy and i was hoping he would somehow turn out to be a hero, but when he turns out to be a junkie i think my hopes for a satisfying finale were extinguished.
maybe the fact that 3 men are supposedly in love with the main character is the romantic attraction of this book.  or is it jo's suffering that is intended to be attractive?  perhaps i was ultimately disappointed because of the promising start, but my advice is to skip this book.",promising start...but ultimately disappointing,1066780800,A1TSNZW1H9BNN3,Barbara
3674,3,"i bought and read this book when i was 13 and visited london.  at 13 i adored it passionately.  at much older than 13, i find it a bit laughable.
first, i agree with several reviewers who object to the ""strong, independent"" heroine being raped and abused, and finding her ""happily ever after"" with one (!!!) of her rapists.  his excuse was that he was hypnotically regressed to king john at the time.  oh, well, of course.
the historical parts of the book are outstanding, detailed and well-researched, and they win 100% of the three stars that i give this book.  readers of sharon kay penman's _here be dragons_ will find this an excellent companion piece.  in fact, if you love medieval welsh history, i highly recommend getting this book and just flipping the pages whenever the modern characters appear.
the original cover art i have from my british edition reads, ""fascinating, absorbing, and original."" the first two are subjective, but as many reviewers have pointed out, it is hardly original; anya seton's _green darkness_ and mary luke's _nonesuch lure_ played the same themes at least 20 years before _lady of hay_ was published.  but it became even less original when barbara erksine began searching out abused women in british history and did the same thing over and over again, injecting historically inaccurate feminism along the way.  _lady of hay_ is definitely the best of her efforts in the past-life regression genre.","wonderful history, it's the modern people i want gone...",1052352000,AJFDUH3VTZDGB,E.

'here be dragons' is ten times the book this is.  if i have one pet peeve it would have to be authors who command their characters to do illogical things.  case in point: at the beginning of this novel, the title character jo, has just broken off a relationship with the man in her life who has gone off to pursue another woman yet, there is no discussion of what preciptated the breakup and the heroine nonchalantly allows the 'rat' to waltz blithely in and out of her life and apartment without batting an eyelash.  the 'rat' and his brother also have a relationship about as fraternal as kane and abel but there is no discussion whatsoever as to why.  i also found it rather ridiculous that all the men in jo's modern existence had all followed her from her previous incarnation 800 years ago!  the heroine also runs around wales falling spontaneously into regressive hypnotic trances at the drop of a 'milady'.  the author even had one of her 800 year old, medieval characters utter ""hey"" like he was hailing a cab.  c'mon!  maybe this book should be better classified as science fiction?  i am as willing as the next person to suspend disbelief for the sake of a good yarn but because of the author's inablity to flesh out the details to make her protagonists credible i found the characters of this novel did not develop beyond cardboard cutouts.  my advice:  you money and your time would be better spent on 'here be dragons' by sharon kay penman.  go read the reviews on this site for that book.",ridiculous and disappointing,1009756800,A2EUAP29LV67HG,Linda S.

this is not a feel good, happy ending book.  it is a look at the harsh realities of life for a woman in a small town - a small town where everyone knows everything you do and your reputation is, if not everything, almost everything.  these people can be nosy and downright cruel in some cases, but also warm and supportive and giving.  if you can stick through the first third of the book, it is worth the read.","a slow start, but worth the read.",1291939200,AL5NXND21JBAT,S.

3924,3,"the first part of this novel was a superb 99 pages.  my enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact i grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  here is why:

part one is about a child named grania growing up in canada in the late 1800's.  a bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  thankfully, grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  i know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  when she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  the teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure grania understands what is going on.  the children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  when grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  it is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.

part two is about an adult grania who falls in love with a hearing man named jim.  jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  i found his conversations with grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  my mind began to wander.

part three follows jim as he enters world war one and the fighting he experiences or sees.  this created a problem for me, as i said earlier, jim just didn't hold my interest.

part one seemed a novel all of its own.  the style changed after that.  i realize the story is about grania and jim and world war one, but it just was not written the same as part one.  i encourage people searching for deaf fiction and literature to pick this one up tho.","excellent first part, a bit downhill from there",1251504000,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,Tara
3925,3,"canadian author frances itani had a promising idea to write about the education and early life of a girl struck deaf in infancy, as her own grandmother was at the turn of the last century. and it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in world war i. the novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.

grania o'neill -- the name is an anglicization of the irish for ""love"" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. she wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. she has an ally in her grandmother mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. but i found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into grania's world. i was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.

as a young adult, grania falls in love and marries. but it is 1915, and her husband jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. the unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as sebastian faulks'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/birdsong/dp/0679776818/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">birdsong</a>. and the scenes back in canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. but the fact remains that there is an ocean between grania and jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and grania teaches him once more to talk.

this is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. it calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose. the steady narrative that itani offers contains much that will interest and even move its readers, but for this reader at least the most exciting promises are lost.",sign language,1221264000,A8IPQ1Q1O7YX5,Roger Brunyate

  the authors are brave and bold.  they scorn financial risks as well as safety measures when they're around lions.  no sparing of the harshness and violence that goes with surviving in a sometimes terribly harsh environment.

  but this couple leave me cold.  over seven years they get to know and name the animals they're studying.  but when one of these creatures die, not so much as a shrug?  any introspection is limited to money needs, food, camp matters.  it practically cries out for comedy relief or reflection; not just chronological  narrative.

the owens' lions, used to people letting them roam around camp and sit down among them, and anthropomorphized with cute names like muffin, were clearly going to get into trouble the first time they met other, less starry-eyed people in the kalahari or in the villages and towns surrounding it. the owens did them a real disservice.

i can see why this story would appeal to a young audience. an orphan girl, mary, is left to roam about on her uncle's estate without having to go to school. she can run and play outdoors unchaperoned and, when she gets hungry, show up at meal times. moreover, when it rains, she can explore the 100-room mansion like it was her private playground. who wouldn't love to have such a life especially as a child? yes, she's lonesome, but she develops friendships. her parents' deaths from cholera don't seem to have affected her at all since they neglected her.

the problem, unfortunately, was when colin appeared about halfway through the story. the focus shifted away from mary as the central character to colin and his health problem and tantrums. mary was subsequently pushed to the back burner. at this point, the story became tedious. i skimmed to the end where mrs. medlock sees mr. craven and his son walking side by side. we're given a happy ending, but again, mary is shunted aside and disappears at the end.","overrated ""classic""",1482278400,A235IF7V4XS5HB,Zoo

4371,4,"oppel's airborn is pretty entertaining, with plenty of high-stakes adventure and frisky action.

matt cruse was born in the skies, and now he has returned to them to work on an airship (which dominate the skies in this alternate history). on one of his trips, matt helps rescue a balloonist, whose last words and journal seem to indicate he's seen flying animals so far unidentified by science. they drift above an uncharted island in the ""pacificus.""

when the balloonist's granddaughter, kate, arrives aboard matt's airship a year later, she drags him into her quest to locate the island and identify the flying creatures. she feels this will bring meaning to her grandfather's death.

life above the airship is portrayed in creative and convincing detail. things get a little less convincing about halfway through the book.

i was happily surprised that the adventure is supplemented with better than average characterization. the budding feelings matt feels towards the pretty and spunky kate are well-articulated, and you don't get the unbelievable infatuation-at-first sight so common in this genre. the villain is not uniformly evil; we get a glimpse of his softer side. even the handsome, rich, seemingly perfect son of the airship's owner shows levels of complexity, whereas such a character is usually portrayed as a boring goody-goody with no brains or a secret scoundrel.

the biggest shortcoming is of airborn, unfortunately, one that is common in the ya adventure novel: believability. do teenagers really save the world/airship/mission almost entirely without the assistance of adults? and matt's ship just ""happens"" to crash on the island identified by the balloonist? really?

those issues aside, i think this book will be greatly enjoyed by tweens and teens 12-16.","light and entertaining, with better characterization than many similar tween and teen adventure titles",1384646400,A2OUWIDQGB98QR,Bibliophilic

4404,1,"the negative review relates to the physical product, not to the contents of the book itself.

the physical product that was shipped today looks nothing like the book depicted, and was not what i expected.  what i ordered was a hard-cover book, which i anticipated would look something like the airship with the gold ""airborn"" caption depicted prominently on the product page.

instead, what i received was a primarily blue colored book with a red ""airborn"" text.  the picture itself is not a big deal.  but what is particularly disappointing is the quality of this little hard cover book.  i've posted a few pictures of this product.

first, it's much smaller than anticipated.  it's about the size of a standard soft cover book.  7 inches tall by 4.25 inches wide.

pages are not bound via stitching, as is typical of hardcover books, but are instead glued to a thin strip of cloth.  if this book were heavily read, i expect that the pages will eventually drop out.  the pages are typical newsprint quality, normally associated with soft cover books.  unlike the quality paper typically used in hardcover books, i expect that over time these would yellow.

what i expect from a hard cover book is something that will last a long time, and look great on my bookshelf.  this book doesn't meet those criteria.

this will be returned.  unfortunately, amazon does not have the higher quality hardcover book in stock.  once the return is processed, i'll probably order a soft-cover version of this.

again, the quality of the physical product, the hard-cover book, is what's being reviewed here.  once i get a decent replacement, i trust the story is as good as other reviewers have indicated.",physical product shipped was disappointing (see photos).,1315872000,AN3AC0ZDVVRX8,Ken
4405,5,"as i was collecting my basic information for this book, i noticed something on goodreads. people seem to either love this book or hate this book. i am one of the people that love this book, and i'm having difficulties understanding what people didn't like. i saw one reviewer complain about the first person narration (valid, if that's not your deal), some complain about the female lead being annoying (and okay, kate is a bit haughty)... but one person said the book started too slowly. my only response to this is an inquisitive head tilt and a feeling that we might not be reading the same book. as i review books i am learning that i am a plot reader.  i can deal with books that are primarily about the development of the main character when it's done well (a la john green's books), but plot is mostly where it's at for me.
 and i thought the plot development of airborn was fantastic. we start in the ship with matt cruse, cabin boy for the airship aurora. he generally acts as a lookout for the ship and as a waiter for the passengers, but in the very first chapter they spot a hot air balloon is distress. matt (as the lightest on the ship) has the job of swinging out on to the balloon to hook it so the crew can save the poor old man in the balloon. the man asks matt if he saw ""them,"" and matt lies to appease the dying man. again folks, this is still the first chapter or two.
 then we jump to two years later, and matt is stewarding for passenger kate de vries, a wealthy girl about his age. he learns that she is the granddaughter of the old man and that she is looking for these odd winged panthers he wrote about in his journal just before his death.  this might be the slow part the review was referring to, but i can't for the life of me see why. from here there's a bit less plot, but we get super-detailed world building about the general goings-on of the ship... until the plot really takes off.
 another point i was really fond of: bruce lombardi is a character that is the ""other guy"" in a lot of respects. he and matt are in fairly constant competition, but bruce is still a really likable character (which is especially a feat, considering the first-person narration).  kate is a bit much to deal with sometimes, but i'd rather have a feisty, bossy heroine over a swoony, blank-page heroine any day. plus, let's remember that she's young and immature. hermione was a pain in the first harry potter book too, remember?
 so why am i holding back from giving it a 10? i don't really know. i really, really like it, but it's not hitting that book-so-good-i'm-obsessed stage, where i would recommend it to everyone (like white cat by holly black or the hunger games by suzanne collins). possibly it's because it's so super into its genre, which i feel might be a moderate turn-off for all the reviewers who didn't like it on goodreads. we shall see if that changes after skybreaker. stay tuned!

additional thoughts:  now that books are available to me in so many formats (and i am without a job outside of school for the first time... possibly ever) i find myself rating books on a monetary betting system. for example, i know that i will buy red glove in hardback the day it comes out. i loved white cat that much. anything by john green generally also makes the buy first, ask questions later list. other things, like anna and the french kiss get e-readered because i've heard good things, but may not be totally sure they'll be my kind of thing. and then there's the library, where i grab anything and everything.
 this series may have started in the library for me, and it's going to continue in the library due to lack of funds, but at some point in the future there will be a complete hardback set with matching covers of this trilogy gracing my shelves. i would definitely re-read airborn, and from reading the back cover of skybreaker i imagine the trend is just going to continue.
 this book won a printz honor award, so that means official people thought it was awesome too.
 wikipedia also tells me that there is a movie based on the book due out sometime this year, but they've already tried to adopt it into a movie that didn't pan out in 2008. so the movie might be stuck in movie-limbo right next to the ender's game movie (and probably for about the same reasons).

4426,3,"anyone who longs for more adventures in the time period and vein of robert louis stevenson and jules verne will love this book. it truly is a throw back to these authors, not only in the time period, but the style of writing and the strong characters taking part in the adventure. matt cruse rivals stevenson's jim hawkins in every way, and the rest of the supporting cast is just as strong. even the main antagonist carries with him admirable qualities both in refinement and intellect that make him more than the one-dimensional bad guy many books in this genre portray.

overall, it starts out a little slow, building toward the action, but once oppel brings the reader into it, there's no turning back. it's not life-altering literature, but it's a great read, taking advantage of the unexplored world of airships in a captivating way. oppel is an author who's authentic to his fantasy, creating believable worlds with believable characters, even in anthropomorphizing animals, like in his silverwing trilogy, a task few take on and even fewer do successfully. as this series advances to explore through the various iterations of the merger between adventure and technology, matt cruse's stories, i'm sure, will continue to captivate readers. i recommend this book to both adults and kids, with its main audience falling within the range of 8-13, geared more toward boys.

4457,5,"i found this book so engaging that i finished it in a week. there are airships. there are pirates. there are mysterious creatures. there is more swashbuckling than you can shake a fake cutlass at. there is so much goodness in this book that i want to eat it just to get every last bit of goodness out and have it for my very own.

this book is good enough to justify giving the author some slack when he makes up really lame terms for things in his alternate world such a ""hydrium"" gas, which makes his giant airships float, or ""alumiron"", the strong-but-light metal out of which their huge frames are made. it is good enough to read even though the main characters are a cabin boy and a rich girl of the same age, both with dreams and daddy issues.

these minor cliches do not matter because this book is really--really!--good. it is funny and sad and real and exciting. it gets the action rolling on the second page and reels you in before it starts deftly feeding you healthy doses of exposition. it has descriptions of lighter-than-air travel that will make you hop online to check out the nearest place where you can charter a dirigible. it has a really cool mysterious creature that does not form an emotional bond or telepathic link with anyone, which is in itself such an original idea that it could float the entire story by itself. (i jest. a little.) it has a plucky rich girl who is forced to stop dreaming long enough to realize that she's really rather selfish and manipulative for all that she's charming and funny. it has a grave young cabin boy who is compelled to lighten up a little. did i mention the airships and pirates? it has those. it is. so! good!",mmm....dirigibles.,1157414400,A3QIMGRM0GW8NU,Marie Anderson

4467,3,"this book takes place in an alternative world where airships (blimps) powered with the lighter-than-air gas hydrium are the main mode of long distance travel, not airplanes. also the atlantic and the pacific are the atlanticus and pacificus instead (my how creative).

the main character is a cabin boy named matt, who becomes friends with a wealthy passenger named kate, who enlists his help in proving that her grandfather, who died a year earlier, was not crazy when he claimed he saw an undiscovered flying species.  when the airship crashes on the very island kate's grandfather saw the creatures at, kate gets the perfect opportunity and sets out to find the creatures in order to convince the scientific community that her grandfather was not crazy.

which is such  a boring plot. for most of the book, all that happens is that kate and matt wander around the forrest looking for ""cloud cats"" and matt worries about how to save the aurora (the airship). 250 pages in, about two thirds, something suspenseful finally happens. from then on, the book is a real page-turner. but the end is not at all worth all the earlier plodding. i would have chucked the book long before page 250, except that i wanted to finish it so i could write a review.

plus, the characters are about as exciting and complex as cardboard. matt has no personality whatsoever, and the way he keeps given in to kate when he knows he'll get in trouble disgusts me. and kate is sort of a female character type b. she's the standard strongwilled girl whom the male character can't help falling in love with. she has no personality either. and the romance was so lame. ""i liked how it felt when she squeezed my arm."" yes, he actually said that. there was absolutely no chemistry between them. i hesitate to say ""romance,"" because it was so bland it hardly deserves that name. of course, when you have a bland boy falling in love with a bland girl, bland romance is what you get.

anyway, it was a bad book. who cares whather they discover some new creature? that's hardly very suspenseful. and i've read unsuspenseful books and really liked them because i loved the characters. but the author fails there too. i would have given it two stars, except for the part at the end.",sooo boring,1150329600,A1VV7CYDH0UWYB,sarah v

4500,3,"first off, when i checked this book's stats out on goodreads, i saw a long line of 5 star rankings from friends of mine. they are all really good friends, whose reviews i love. i was amazed that my opinion about this little book differed so much, and a bit nervous that i might tread on a few toes because it seems to be such a sentimental favourite. then i remembered that when i first read it many years ago, i might have ranked it higher too, so maybe they're cruising on memory to some extent (sorry if that's you).

the story begins so grim, there's got to be a hea (happily ever after) implied, because it can't get any worse. so far so good. i don't mind the direction from horrible to good. it's the opposite movement which gets rough, especially for kids' books.  it begins in india, where everyone dies a horrible, painful death of cholera, except for mary lennox, the neglected little girl who was ignored by her parents and basically brought up by slaves. she's found days later in the aftermath, and sent off to england to live under the roof of a cranky uncle, mr archibald craven.

from a modern perspective, there is lots of pious author intrusion. burnett never missed the opportunity to drop in moralistic comments, such as 'mary really was a disagreeable, self-centered and imperial child'. yeah thanks, i think we get that idea without being told, but that was how some authors did things back then. you whack readers over their heads with your theme, just to be certain they don't miss it.

young colin's plight is seriously disturbing. a boy who has basically nothing wrong with him is left lying in bed for his first ten years, conditioned into hypochondria and believing he's going to die, because that's the line he's always taken on board from the adults. in all that time, he's never even attempted to walk because he believes there's no point. he rarely, if ever, leaves his bedroom. and he's never been outside in his life. yet they just mumble insulting things about him beneath their breath (which he overhears) and kowtow to his face because he's the master's son, and they have to observe their ridiculous social pecking order.

burnett kept calling mary a hard, unloving little girl, and colin a cantankerous, sickly boy who believed he was going to die, as if this was all their own fault. come on, they were ten-year-old kids, and the incompetent adults shaped them this way, by the way they treated them. mary wasn't given an ounce of love by her parents in india, yet she's expected to show love and be a normal cheesy child in her new home. where do they expect her to pull that from? and colin is always told, 'lie down and take it easy, my boy,' and never, 'why don't you lean on my arm and come to the window seat for some sunshine?' then they have the nerve to complain about him throwing the occasional tantrum.

when mary and colin end up proving that neither of them are really the monsters the adults turned them into, nobody thinks to say, 'whoops, our bad.' i never expected to feel so angry reading this for the second time. talk about indulging in forms of child abuse, then blaming the children for their own perceived shortcomings. it's a horror story, in a way.

good on mary and colin, for taking matters into their own hands. i've come across people who have criticized kids' books for what they call 'glorifying disobedience', even when the young heroes end up saving the day (take harry potter stories, and other more modern ones). the same thing happens in the secret garden, from the moment mary decides to investigate the strange sound of crying for herself. the adults deserved to have their authority flouted, because they consistently made the dumbest decisions. why keep mary and colin apart from each other in the first place? and why the heck didn't anyone ever think to introduce colin and boy wonder dickon to each other earlier, since they lived in the same vicinity? the adults are the baddies here, and there's no two ways about it.

another thing i must have overlooked during my first read through as a kid was frances hodgson burnett's strong metaphysical agenda in the writing of the story. she has colin deciding to chant, 'magic is in me, magic is making me well.' when the children discuss this together, he says, 'perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen.' and there are several similar quotes, particularly thick toward the end. some readers might throw around terms like white magic, spells, incantations, self-reliance and sorcery. whether or not you buy into all that, it comes across as if she's elevating the human mind and giving kids the message that they're totally in control of their destiny. if they only think enough good thoughts, these will transform their life circumstances and make things wonderful. that's a bit dodgy and limited however you want to look at it.

there are a few nice, heartwarming parts about enjoying the garden, but not enough to make up for all that i just ranted about. the crocuses, snowdrops, lilies, jonquils, narcissus, jasmine and daffodils (or daffydowndillies) get good mentions. my favourite part is when ben weatherstaff, the gruff old gardener, chokes up with emotion when his friend, the robin (the real hero of the story in my opinion) decides to honour him by landing on the handle of his shovel. it's nice to see unlikely friendships, including a crusty old guy and a bright little bird.

so yeah, that's it overall, and i have to wonder whether my list of friends who have given the book 5 stars have rated that on a long forgotten, nostalgic read in their youth, rather than the sort of recent, no-frills read i just had.",the adults are the baddies,1471996800,A1CD29SRFNFHU1,Paula Vince

4598,5,"cat chant and his sister gwendolen are orphaned, and move to chrestomanci castle to stay with distant family. this is set in an alternative reality, where magic is controlled by the chrestomanci and his team of world-hopping magicians. i first read this as a young teen, and still drop in on it, 30 years later, when i want a comforting, nostalgic read.",a 30 year love affair,1431129600,A7BX31D8WOPD1,Annabel C
4602,4,"diana wynne jones has a wonderfully whimsical ability to worldbuild (of which j.k. rowling should be jealous). books with magic in are slowly tending to become more technological (as our technology becomes more magical, perhaps, or maybe it's just because of games in which magic has to be ""balanced""); there are clear rules for what can and can't be done. this author was writing before that trend, or ignored it, and her magic is like the magic of folktales. it works because it ought to work, because having it work that way is cool.

she was also writing before ""head-hopping"" (switching between third-person viewpoints in the middle of a scene) became so denigrated, and a couple of times it's disorientating. her style is the simple, declarative style of books for younger readers, but there's nothing wrong with that, though if i'd been her editor i would have said ""show, don't tell"" a couple of times and suggested more active phrasings for a few sentences. the writing, in other words, isn't flawless, but the story, the characters and especially the world make up for it.

the main viewpoint character is a boy known as cat, for reasons that, when explained, turn out to be very important. he's afflicted with a sister named gwendolen, who is as self-centred as a gyroscope and reacts badly to being thwarted, causing a cascade of trouble for poor cat. by the middle of the book he's in not just one, but four or five bad situations, with no solution in sight, and all of them are gwendolen's fault.

the secondary characters are delightful. the powerful chrestomanci, in particular, with his beautiful clothes, is like a less self-centred howl, but each one of them has some characteristic of appearance or mannerism that makes them distinct and memorable.

this is the first of a series of six books, and i'll be reading the others too, i think.","memorable characters, fun world",1389830400,A1IV3OJ6YBL348,Mike Reeves-McMillan

a friend of mine bought this book for her 9 year old daughter who loved reading it. the book is set in a parallel universe were magic is commonplace. england in this parallel universe is slightly quaint and magic is an extension of every day life. the themes are common in children's books that deals with magic:  a young protagonist who learns about his past and his place in the world; conflict within the family; an antagonist who threatens to overthrow the natural order. in fact in the basic set up there are many similarities to harry potter and the philosopher's stone.",a wonderful children book. fun to read.,1363132800,A1ZV7CZUDQPFA2,Amazon Customer

4658,4,"during the night, my little boy tipped over his toy bin and used it to scale his bookshelves. this morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them. for the most part, he would lose interest after a page or two, but a few he listened to right until the end. those books deserve a write-up.

that he listened all the way through the berenstains' b book surprised me. i did lose interest after about the fourth page, but he was loving all those bs, so i read it to the end. this is a silly little book, which, not shockingly emphasizes the letter b. it becomes quite a tricky tongue-twister long before you reach the end of the book. i couldn't really tell you what specifically my three-year-old liked about the book, but he did really enjoy it.

the illustrations feature the funnel-snouted animals of the berenstains -- cute and colorful, but not easily recognizable, and, therefore not my favorite style. again, my little boy liked all the silly images and colors, even if he didn't believe me that the bear was supposed to be a bear.",b is for brilliant,1375142400,A1PWJRR0T57SLB,Psyche
4667,5,"my family discovered this book when my younger brother was the age for picture books, and we all loved it.  in fact, we can still quote it by heart.

the book is really just a list of things that start with the letter b, but the berenstains have managed to create a story that's a lot of fun with it.  we follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  what happens?  well, they bump into all kinds of things.  and the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.

as i said, we all loved this book.  it was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.  each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos.  and the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly.

this is a true classic picture book.  if you can find a copy, you're family will love it.",your kids will be bouncing to read this book again,1330300800,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,Mark Baker - Carstairs Considers

4759,2,"i had read these as a child and loved them.  reading them with my daughter, i was both delighted (to share an experience of my youth) and also, increasingly, appalled.  it isn't the religion that bothers me... but lewis comes off as something of a crank even by the standards of his time: dumb characterizations of reformist trends within his own society, casual racism, and - again even by the standards of the time - a remarkable sexism.  i'm not talking about the big stuff that is the focus of articles; rather the casual comments about ""boys are like this...; girls are like that...""  this isn't simply the novels being of a different time.  it was shockingly regressive even when it was written.

was my daughter excited about the talking animals?  yes, but the truth is the prose is pretty awful, the descriptions long (at least for a six year old), and the models of virtue pretty awful by any standards (and, as it happens, i'm fairly conservative and raise my family accordingly).  a ""classic""?  i suppose, but not one that i would recommend",i loved it as a child.  hated reading it to my child now that i'm an adult.,1510704000,A14BAROCIAMNRK,Old Duffler

the writing is fun and not presumptuous. the plot is a little expositive, you're shown what is to come and the present is not as interesting (very debatable, my personal view). i think the witch should have had more development and more time on the spotlight as her arrival could bring a lot more (fun) chaos to the story. a lost opportunity i guess.

""too old""? this seems a rather arbitrary ruling, at best.

* for one thing, lucy and her siblings were allowed to grow into adulthood in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe (lww). no exact ages are given (even for the younger versions of the pevensie children, for that matter) but we can assume they are at least in their twenties. why were they allowed to abide in narnia for so long? weren't they too old?

* lucy is at least three years younger than peter and edmund is at least two years younger, yet, by the timeline of the chronicles, it's been only two years since the pevensie children came back to their world through the wardrobe. so, by that count, lucy is still not as old in vdt as peter was in lww; edmund may be about the same age. yet peter was allowed to reenter narnia in prince caspian which is a year later than lww which puts edmund at least a year younger in vdt than peter was in prince caspian, when he and susan were deemed too old to ever come back to narnia.

* in prince caspian, aslan exposits that the telmarines are descended from a group of pirates who entered narnia through a portal on a remote island. weren't these pirates too old to have entered narnia? in lww, it's said that susan and lucy, as queens in adulthood, had many suitors from lands beyond the sea. presumably, these people (who somehow had enough time to set up their own societies) came to the world of narnia through portals of their own (given the implication that humans are not native to narnia). weren't they too old?

* what is narnia anyway? the map shows narnia as a country, not the entire other world. besides narnia, there are other countries, such as telmar, archenland and calormen as well as all the lands visited by caspian and his friends in vdt. is narnia all these lands as well as its own separate country? if not, and lucy and edmund are too old to visit narnia again, are they also banned from going to archenland, etc? this is not very well-defined.",narnia: land of the magical and...arbitrary,1463788800,A8IZXBE7J6RNJ,ApeLieUproar

5459,2,"i am so conflicted about this book.  i had read the first four books in this series when i was a child, but had never finished the series.  when my 9 year old son read the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe for school and then all the rest within the following month, it prompted me to go back and read these and actually finish the series.  the whole time i was reading the last battle i was bothered by c.s. lewis' apparent obsession with how stupid everything was.  he describes people and things as stupid nearly on every page.  now, i realize that stupid is not widely believed to be a ""bad"" word, but i discourage its use with my children because it just breeds so much negativity into one's heart and mind, especially since it is so easily thrown about without a second thought.  i just didn't feel like a book series based in christianity needed to have so many ""downer"" words so lavishly sprinkled throughout (damn was used as well).

finally, the ending.  ugh.  i found it so upsetting and disturbing, especially for a kids' series.  it was just too morbid, and since this was the last book, there is no chance for it to redeem itself.  i just felt like it was a horrible way to end a series that could have been so beloved, and it left a yucky feeling behind.  as i read i was pleased to see the reappearance of lucy, edmund, and peter, but then when we find out why, it totally ruins it, especially since susan was not there.  perhaps it would have been better served if lewis had never written beyond the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, and we could have forever been left with pleasant memories of the magical land of narnia.",big disappointment,1434672000,A3HGURP3KCQROA,H4ever

5725,3,"this was good, yet having said that, it paled in comparison to the lion, the witch and the wardrobe.  by the middle of the story my son said aloud im a little bored, and i agreed with him.  i had hoped that the latter half of the story would gain momentum.  i was annoyed during a scene when lucy told her brothers and sister that she saw aslan and none of them believed her.  after what happened before, with her discovering narnia through the wardrobe, they should have given her the benefit of the doubt.  i found that hard to believe.  the underlying message was about how faith can be hard to see sometimes yet its there and as long as you believe, it can lead you where you need it go.

i loved how the pevensie kids were pulled back into narnia by susans own horn to aid king caspian, the true heir to the throne of narnia.  the kingdom was run by rather oppressive humans who were attempting to abolish all memory and knowledge of the land's talking animals and mythical creatures, not to mention the legend of the pevensies themselves.  i found it curious when they first arrived come to discover that they had returned hundreds of years after they had reigned there as kings and queens.  that was the most interesting part of the story for me.

as they tried to find their way in narnia the siblings bickered about one of the differences between boys and girls.  susan didn't remember the woods they found themselves in so edmund said thats the worst of girls; they never carry a map in their heads.  lucy promptly replied: thats because our heads have something inside them.

i thought prince caspian was good-hearted, albeit nave.  he was a decent young man who was loyal to family almost to his detriment.  when his father died his power-hungry uncle miraz had seized the position of the king and caspian never questioned it.  i expected a confrontation between prince caspian and so-called king miraz to set things right.  instead it was anti-climactic and ended rather abruptly.

i liked the moment aslan roared and something magical stirred; it awoke creatures and living things that had long lain dormant in narnia.  what lucy and susan saw was a dark something coming to them from almost every direction across the hills.  it looked first like a black mist creeping on the ground, then like the stormy waves of a black sea rising higher and higher as they came on, and then, at last, like what it waswoods on the move.",good to be back in narnia,1412985600,AIAHQNMPP1TBL,GO

5739,3,"i vaguely remember reading this series, specifically the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, when i was a little girl but i do not remember the details.  now i mostly refer to seeing the first movie.  my 11 year old son started reading these at school so i decided to join in from home.  i decided to read the series chronologically rather than by their publication order.

this was a simple story with a selfish, mental if you ask me, uncle who had no regard for the well-being of his nephew.  he experimented with his nephews friend, polly, by sending her to an unknown alternate world in the hopes of digory having no choice but to go after her and return and report.  worst guardian ever.  he was devious.  he knew they had stumbled into his forbidden study and waited to pounce.  the high-backed chair in front of the fire moved suddenly and there rose up out of itlike a pantomime demon coming up out of a trapdoorthe alarming form of uncle andrew.

digory and polly go on an adventure seeing several worlds, or places.  i was interested in the devastated place of charn with its old and dying sun.  the room with the frozen people was eerie.  of course, digory was a curious boy who could not help himself by tapping the bell in that room despite the written warning.

this gave a bit of history of where the white witch/queen came from, the magical wardrobe, and the creation of narnia.  i was the most surprised by the wardrobe.  i thought its creation was clever.  i was fascinated by the piece of the lamp-post brought from earth which then grew into a full lamp-post in narnia.  that was an a-ha momentthats where that infamous lamp-post came from.

learning about the deplorable word from the white witch was interesting.  that word decimated every living thing except for the one who uttered the word.  that is detestable, to say the least.  she had a feud over the throne and she blamed her sister.  at any moment i was ready to make peaceyes and to spare her life too, if only she would yield me the throne.  but she would not.  her pride has destroyed the whole world.  the white queen was blinded by her insatiable lust for powerher dark desire to rule the worldincapable of noticing, let alone acknowledging her own pride.  overall it was the age old theme of good versus evil.

excerpt: (a scene with a carriage) there was no one in the drivers seat.  on the roofnot sitting, but standing on the roofswaying with superb balance as it came at full speed round the corner with one wheel in the airwas jadis the queen of queens and the terror of charn.  her teeth were bared, her eyes shone like fire, and her long hair streamed out behind her like a comets tail.  she was flogging the horse without mercy.  it went on further, the carriage crashing into the lamp-post and the witch jumping onto the back of the horse.  i thought it was an exhilarating moment.",adventurous with narnia history,1411430400,AIAHQNMPP1TBL,GO

all in all, the book was good albeit slow and in many ways frivolous. it was interesting and enjoyable to learn about and better understand narnia and how it came to be and in that sense this book was the best prequel / entry book to the series in my opinion.

i look forward to the other books in the series and hope that the plot gets better, or potentially just has more action.

at times i did wish it did not force it's message so strongly, for at times i felt it had no purpose other than to teach religious meanings but this could just be an ""adult"" (am i really?) issue where we read into things more than we are meant to.

prince caspian is told by his nurse stories of an old narnia where there are talking beasts and aslan is the high king.  miraz, caspian's uncle, hears of this and quickly gets rid of the nurse and hires a tutor for caspian.  miraz does not want anyone discussing the old narnia; he likes it much better the way it is now with him as the ruler of narnia.  the new tutor teaches caspian and helps him escape when it is learned that caspian is to be killed so he will not take his rightful place as king of narnia.  caspian flees his home and soon comes upon an unlikely group of animals; they are talking beasts.  trufflehunter (a badger) and trumpkin (a red dwarf) turn out to be caspian's strongest allies and assist him on his journey to evade miraz's army.  with the assistance of the talking beasts and the pevensie's, caspian must fight to take his rightful place in narnia.

5936,3,"review of the characters:

king trinian you got to feel bad for the guy, here he is king of narnia and having a jolly time when the antichrist in the form of an ape comes to spoil it for him. i also really admired his determination, if i was him i would have given up at the utter lack of hope in each situation but king trinian presses on and fights for the beloved narnia. he was a more fleshed out character than prince caspian and rillian in the sense that he was actually flawed. he acted on impulses instead of reason several times in the beginning of the novel which contributed to the overall fate of narnia. even with this though i felt as if he were a place holder, his only purpose was to be our eyes to the happenings in narnia. i felt bad for him because he certainly had a lot on his plate but never once did i feel his pain, feel his joy. as a protagonist its kind of essential to establish such a connection with the reader but lewis wasn't as concerned about connecting to the readers. (ill get to that later).

jewel  a unicorn! finally, in my opinion a unicorn was very much missing from lewiss other works. i mean, its narnia for goodness sakes; a place full of centaurs, fawns, dryads i kept wondering when a unicorn would make his appearance and low and behold jewel trots my way. his relationship to the king was endearing and actually helps heighten the king as a character. again, though theres no real connection to jewel; i couldn't sympathize with him. im not exactly sure jewel moved the story forward at all which kind of reveals the fact that lewiss main focus was not the characters. he had something to say in this story and instead of using characters like jewel to enhance it, he kind of just threw them in there to react to it.

 shift meet our antichrist, our ape, our reason for the ending of narnia as we know it. hate him already? yeah i did too. from the first page his cunning ways and exploitation of puzzle  leaped out from the page, almost demanding the readers hatred. and unlike eustace in the voyage of the dawn treader, shift has none of the endearing wit in his comments, just an obvious sense of selfishness which i guess makes sense since lewis never meant to redeem shift like he did with eustace. also, i wasn't kidding about the antichrist bit, shift is an allegorical reference to the antichrist talked about in the novel. his clever tongue and plan soon have all of narnia (a bit far-reaching if you ask me) convinced that aslan wants to sell everyone into slavery and let the calormenes rule. he talks of aslan and tash (the god that the calormenes worship) being one deity equating aslan to half man/half bird beast. basically, he soon has the majority of narnia questioning their faith (as no one has seen aslan for hundreds of years) and exploiting their weaknesses. it was interesting the way his words worked on the crowd but also frightening the way how easily they worked, im pretty sure lewis was saying something about humanity with that

 puzzle i really, really, really loved puzzle even though i know i shouldnt. it is because of his ignorance that the ape is able to work his scheme and i cant excuse it. let me explain. in the beginning it is proven how low puzzle thinks of himself in terms of brain power. he believes himself incredibly stupid especially standing next to his best friend shift, but puzzle has a very good heart. he always acts with the best intentions and strives to be a good friend. therefore his ignorance is supposed to be forgiven and usually i would not be okay with that. i don't care how bad shift made you feel about not pretending to be aslan puzzle, don't do it! you know nothing good will come of it, but of course all shift has to do is say he knows more than puzzle and puzzle simple nods his head and goes along with it. i was not happy at first with the way that played out but puzzles personality is so redeeming. he is really the only character in which i had a personal connection, i felt scared for him when he was in danger from the crowd and i felt bad for him when had to face aslan after everything he had done. so even though the initial thought behind puzzle annoys me, his personality won me over in the end.

review of the story:

this story is much different from the rest of the chronicles of narnia in the sense that lewis wasn't trying to give us more of narnia, he was trying to end it and as such the last battle had a much darker tone than most narnian fans would expect. the story is heart breaking, truly, from the first page to the last its filled with lack of hope and a frailty. the other books were light and gave you a feeling of preservation and determination, as if good could conquer all. that was not present in this novel and i guess it could be expected with the title the last battle, i mean, that pretty much screams impending doom. however, reading a book where every fight is lost, every plan vanquished and every hope lost is not a fun read. its hard to enjoy because theres no rollercoaster for the reader, we start at sad and stay at sad.

i should  note that i may be a bit biased having just read all of the other books in this series so i may not have perspective. but who wants to see narnia end? when aslan (finally) came out and started ending the world i was bewildered and horrified at the same time. his imagery is very powerful too so it just adds to the horror of seeing our beloved land skinned by giant lizards and dragons and covered in giant waves and flame; then finally the horrible part, darkness. empty, quiet, darkness. if i was a bit younger i would have been bawling. how could lewis make us so attached to this place just to give is such an ending? then we are introduced to the real narnia (heaven) and it  issuppose to be bigger and better than our old one but i couldn't understand how lewis would even try to substitute it.

as a reader it felt like taking a toy with a loose screw to a parent to fix but instead of fixing the parent deems it beyond repair and stomps on it until it is beyond recognition before your very eyes. then they hand you a new toy, a better toy, but you still cant get that image out of your head; you just keep seeing something you loved die a horrible death. thats what it felt like so when we were supposed to be happy because weve reached salvation i couldn't buy into it.  once again, i think this is proof that lewiss intent was not to deliver an epic tale in the land of narnia but rather retell a biblical story.

review of the writing:

i have to say, lewis delivers some of his best imagery in his conclusion to the series. i particularly liked this passage where lewis describes the stars falling out of the sky, the last few seconds before the rain of stars had quite ended were very exciting. stars falling all around them. but stars in that world are not the great flaming globes they are in ours. they are people. so now they found showers of glittering people, all with long hair like burning sliver and spears like white-hot metal rushing down to them out of the black air, swifter than falling stones. they made a hissing noise as they landed and burnt the grass. and all these stars gliding past them and stood somewhere behind, a little to the right.  lewis makes you see (and even smell) it all as its happening and although we may not want to (it is the end of the world after all) its captivating to read.

from the first line of the first page you can tell this novel is a reference to the end of the world biblical passage. we go through the antichrist, judgement day and get to find out whos been naughty or nice. i didn't mind the biblical allusion, just for imagerys sake it was fascinating to read. the animals either got to enter the doorway to aslans country or fade into his shadow into land unknown. then there is aslans country itself or rather heaven where lewis toys with a bit of plato in the sense that there are worlds upon worlds. this new place is the real narnia and it is better and bigger than ever before. the way lewis puts it is quite nice as he says their past adventures were just the title page and this is chapter one. for wanting to tell this biblical story, he did a good job. however, i do feel he sacrificed many elements to do so like characters and plot development to accomplish this feat. i think lewis knew what he was doing though, it seemed like he was done talking about narnia, now he was going to finish it. (much to our dismay).

lets talk about the shed next. the shed in which puzzle was first contained and thusly narnia thought contained aslan started off as a normal shed but slowly evolved to so much more. it soon became this tangent of the story in which everything else revolved around. when it was discovered that something was in the shed, either aslan or tash, everyone was scared to enter it and desperate never to do so. some people who went in came out scarred forever but some that went in simply did not come out ever again. the shed started to represent death and what do people fear most about death? the unknown, we don't what we will face when we die and that is the most frightening aspect of all (that and the fact that its permanent). we soon learn that three things lie after death or in the shed and it depends on your belief. if you believe in aslan (christianity) then heaven awaits you; if you believe in tash (the devil) then a type of hell awaits you. then there are the agnostics and what waits them is nothing. we see a group of dwarves who believe in nothing thrown into the shed and all they see is the inside of a dark shed. so basically, what you believe is what you get. its an interesting concept.

there was a part that i was confused on and i include it in this section because i felt lewis intended it to have deeper meaning which must have gone right over my head. when we get to heaven we see all our pasts protagonists: peter, edmund, lucy, jill, eustace, polly and digory. oh, wait i forgot susan actually no i didnt. lewis wrote susan as someone who is no longer friend to narnia. she no longer believes in aslan and is obsessed with being a teenager i guess. okay (im getting to my point, i promise), at the end of this novel it is discovered that the reason all the protagonists are in heaven, is because they died in railway accident along with their parents. say what? yeah, that was my reaction, but for christians eternal life is everything so no one is upset about it which if fine with me but what about susan? she has now lost her whole family and i cant help but feel like lewis wrote it that way on purpose to punish for no longer believing. am i reading too much into this? im no fan of susan, never have been but im not sure how i warrant wanting to act grown up calls for the death of your family members. any insight?

rating:

lewis was done with the chronicles of narnia before this novel and thats why it misses so much of the magic that enchants the rest of the series. a much darker tone haunts this tale and as such it missed the connection with the marketed reader (children) and weaves a sad tale. a tragic ending to an epic series, the last battle more than likely won't be one i read again.",2 kit kat bars,1392508800,A2XG8RZLE060YX,Lindsey
5938,2,"review of the characters:

prince caspian he was okay. i say okay because there was zero character development with him. from the minute the reader is introduced to prince caspian we see a young, hopeful boy and at the end of the novel we see the same young, hopeful boy. dont get me wrong, he was endearing but also extremely boring. there was no depth and no development making him boring to watch and unrelatable.

susan i never cared for susan when i first read about her in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe but my opinion of her sunk even lower with prince caspian. she grew even more whiny and sulky with every minute that passed and i began to wish one of the other characters would just knock her out to quiet her complaining. she doesnt deserve the title of queen of narnia and she is no role model for women. its not even the same case as edmund in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe in which case edmund does an awful thing and atones for it. susan is simply not a great person and i was actually happy to hear that she won't be coming back to narnia. (though i will miss peter).

trumpkin easily the best character in the novel, because he actually develops. he starts off as a good-natured but skeptical dwarf. however his loyalty trumps all so that though skeptical he will go on any journey that need be. when trumpkin meets peter, susan, edmund and lucy he is humbled as he sees that it is wrong to judge a book by its cover. then he learns about faith when he meets aslan and finds out that just because you don't see something doesnt mean it isn't there. this character grows and along the way gives the reader a good chuckle every now and then.

review of the story:

i have to say i was very disappointed with prince caspian. this story had so much potential with a king usurper, a young prince who is the rightful heir and the old kings and queens of narnia but instead the story fell flat. there is little suspense that builds up during the flashback to prince caspian. this was the only exciting part of the novel. then the reader has to endure a dull journey of the children looking for prince capsians army and then an even more dull battle scene. there was no true character conflict and very little obstacles, the only obstacle being susan not wanting to do anything. i could not believe that the children once again did not believe lucy when she said that she saw aslan, especially after everything they went through in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe. i believed it to be very out of character for them.

review of the writing:

the writing was what it always is with c.s. lewis, charming. he does a great job at speaking to children, not afraid to talk to them as if they were adults. his interactions with the reader always add a level of excitement to the story making for an enchanting read.

rating:

prince caspian is definitely the weakest novel in the chronicles of narnia (so far at least). the problem is this story could have been an epic tale and we all know c.s. lewis has the talent to do so why then did he allow it to fall flat?",1 and a half kit kat bars,1392508800,A2XG8RZLE060YX,Lindsey
5939,4,"review of the characters:

digory i really enjoyed digory. he was very funny with his threats to his uncle and very charming with his bravery of going after polly. i also liked that he made an error. he gave into his curious nature and not only do we see the costs of that error but we see digory actually learn from that error. overall, digory was a fine character and a great introduction to the world of narnia.

polly very much like digory, polly was a charming character. she was someone who was smart with an understanding nature yet full of pride. it was this pride that led to her error, through not as grave as digorys. she let her vanity take the upper hand for a minute and paid greatly. though it is not as obvious that polly learns her lesson as it was with digory, it was still clear that she did. (side note: c.s. lewis referenced many religious themes throughout the novel, one of which was original sin. i was in favor of the fact that he chose  digory to be tempted instead of polly, implying that it is not just women who consider temptation).

uncle andrew you are not supposed to like uncle andrew and the author succeeds in this aspect, though i did not enjoy him for different reasons than the author intended. it seemed that uncle andrew was rotten to the core, there was no redemption for him. the author uses the excuse of his being a magician or mad scientist as his excuse but i did not find it believable. he was human and to be human even one of the worst humans in history is to feel some sort of compassion no matter how small. if uncle andrew had displayed this humanity i would have found him much more realistic.

queen jadis an extremely scary character, it is clear who she references to in religious culture. like uncle andrew there is no redemption for this character, she is evil to the core. however, unlike uncle andrew she is not human so i am more inclined to forgive queen jadis for her lack of compassion. she is truly frightening in her concise ways and if i was a bit younger i might have a nightmare about her, so i guess c.s. lewis accomplished what he wished too with this character.

review of the story:

the story was very fascinating although i am prone to the fantasy genre and as such i may be a bit biased. however, while i enjoyed this charming (for that really is the best word for it) story i did think that its purpose was more to introduce rather than entertain. i have to consider the fact also that it is childrens literature for i found myself wanting the author to go into more detail. i wanted him to expand on the wonders of narnia (for i became enthralled with it) but i think the authors purpose was just to introduce narnia, give us a taste, rather than show everything it could be.

review of the writing:

for childrens literature the writing was really good which is probably why his books are used in classrooms today. i found that his tone was very tongue-in-cheek which i thought was refreshing, especially since it is written for children for it implies that children are smart enough to understand sarcasm the same as adults. through lewiss writing it is easy to see his religious beliefs as he makes references to atonement, original sin and others. i don't usually like it when the author references his religious nature in novels, especially in childrens novels as i sometimes find them to be preachy, but in this case the religious references did not eclipse the story.

6090,3,"a twist of the garden of eden.

finished it over a week ago but with the holidays haven't had time to write a review.

this story is the favorite of many. while i appreciate it's charm and originality, it holds a fairy tale quality like no other of the narnia novels, it didn't wow me as much as its predecessors. i can see why reading this fifth makes sense in the order of writing and publication. i cared more about the prequel because i had already experienced the magic of the world. coming into this first without the intro to narnia and all the magic is holds and would grow to contain would leave me a bit bored.

the beginning was completely different than others and you have two villains here - including a relative who is a magician of sorts dabbling into darker arts. it was awesome to see the evil queen again in her original form, although she appeared to me so differently than her personality did in narnia. i guess all the type and erosion of the heart is responsible for this transformation.

all previous books show a door from our world into narnia, here we glimpse for ourselves the possibilities of other worlds and that there is a portal in between in the form of rivers. the ending was the best with aslan as he is the creator and much is foretold and explained. i do wonder how the witch learned of the deep magic she speaks of in narnia at the silver table - perhaps it was from the fruit. if so, then why didn't she know the deepest and oldest magic too?

polly was an okay sort, but she rubbed me the wrong way as a bit bossy. digory seemed like a realistic boy and one i enjoyed. the room with the witch and the awakening was the second best part of the story outside of the end. i think i liked this book less because it didn't hold the same kind of expectation, of frantic need and rush forward, of urgency. the end delivered that but up until this point it was small scenes thrown together - sometimes for the sake of amusing, sometimes for self exploration, but mainly just bickering between the kiddies.

while so many loved this, even listing as a favorite, i found it slower and containing less magic in it's pages. a worthy sequel in the series but lackluster in quality until the middle and ending.",good but not my favorite of the series,1379635200,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,Paperbackstash

6143,3,"""the magician's nephew"" by c.s. lewis is one of those books i read just because. because i'd read ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"" when i was a kid. because i always wondered what exactly narnia was. because i'd watched all the narnia movies with my kids. because it was sitting on my son's shelf collecting dust and it had a number one written on it: i.e. first book of the series. so because of all those reasons, i wiped the dust off of it and read it.

this book isn't about anyone i was familiar with from the other narnia books/movies. well, i guess aslan is there toward the end, but honestly, the majority of the book is about digory kirke and polly plummer and that was okay, because their story was easy to grasp. you see, these two neighbors met, become friends then decide to explore the attic connecting their houses. unfortunately, during their exploration, they accidently go into the study of digory's uncle andrew, who is a magician. hence the name of our book: the magician's nephew.

once in andrew's study, polly is tricked by digory's almost evil uncle into touching a magic yellow ring which causes her to vanish. it seems uncle andrew has been dabbling in ancient magic that allows one to travel between worlds. in order to save polly, digory is blackmailed by his uncle into testing another magic ring so as to follow polly; our young hero also takes two green ones just in case they can actually try to return home. when digory touches his yellow ring it transports him to a wood between the worlds where he finds polly alive and well. also there is a series of pools which the two discover lead to separate universes.

of course, our two, young adventures decide not to immediately return home to england but to explore a different world and so jump into one of the nearby pools. instantaneously, digory and polly find themselves in a desolate, abandoned city of some strange, ancient world, which they later learn is charn. inside an ancient building, which they surmise must have been a palace, they discover a huge room filled with statuesque figures of charn's former kings and queens. these perfect statues are beautiful beyond compare but seem to degenerate from the fair and wise of the first to the unhappy and cruel of the later. among these images from some long forgotten past, there is a bell and a hammer with these words written:

 make your choice, adventurous stranger
  strike the bell and bide the danger
  or wonder, till it drives you mad
  what would have followed if you had.

the story of narnia start with that bell. everything else spirals out from the fateful choice placed before digory and polly on whether to ring that bell. sure, the rest of the book reveals to us the creation of narnia and its talking animals,, the origins of the lamp-post, the wonders of its first human king and queen, the first evil deed of the white witch, and of course aslan's role in all of it. we are even told how the wardrobe becomes ""the wardrobe"" which ever after will transport some lucky few to narnia. but it begins at the decision before the bell.

all in all, this was a very entertaining story. if i was still a kid i would have undoubtable rated it much higher, but it was still well-worth my time, especially since it answered all the ""how"" questions about narnia. for that reason alone, you should give it a try.",read it because . . .,1374192000,A1P8W0HATB9U86,Wendell
6146,2,"while the last battle is an interesting and satisfying read in how the end of narnia and the arrival of most of the major characters in aslan's country is portrayed,this book has shown a great flaw upon rereadings. we know that susan is excluded from aslan's country and is left alive on earth. some have interpreted her fate as the result of her losing faith in narnia and others have interpreted her fate as that she was excluded from aslan's country because she discovered sex/sexuality. either of those reasons are fair reasons for her exclusion. but here's the problem: the reader is not given any depiction of how she reacted on earth when she learned her parents and siblings had died nor of what her life was like after that. this book is portrayed as having a very happy ending because of peter,edmund,lucy,polly,digoory,jill and eustace getting to be with aslan in his own country forever. yet susan is just blown off as ""no longer a friend of narnia."" and no thought or attention is given to the fact that we now have a teenage girl who has lsot both of her parents and all 3 of her siblings at the same time. as they say,death is toughest on the people the dead leave behind. yet this book trivializes death by giving susan no shift at all and showing no depiction of what she was like when she learned her parents and siblings had died and what her life was like after that. while the story itself is very good and would rank 4 out of 5 stars by itself,i deduct 2 stars from this novel for trivializing death and the effects it has on those left behind. 2 out of 5 stars.",engrossing story but this book trivializes death by what it doesn't show,1374192000,A3D9KO6R1JB845,"Michael Sloane,Tempe,Arizona,United States of America."

the surprises continued as i read the piece. unlike the typical 'children accidentally visit and save narnia' the magician's nephew instead visits a number of worlds, including narnia which he unintentionally infects just as aslan puts the finishing touches on creating the place.

the story follows a many wondrous things happen structure, rather than a more comfortable - setting, tension, resolution - format, which makes the book a little un-compelling. really this book serves entirely as allegory, although i confess the message gets a bit fuzzy - is evil a malevolent alien being plaguing paradise, or is evil just a thoughtless choice by a child? i'm going assume lewis is suggesting both, because the alternative it's i'm to dull to comprehend the message.

6260,3,"5 stars my kindergarten-aged daughter would loudly give these books. (4 for reepicheep all by himself...)

4 stars my 10 year old self would have given them, when they were read to me (in chronological order - horrors!!!) by a teacher, after recess, every day, from start to finish...

1 star i would have likely given them when i read them, just because, 6-7 years ago.

3 stars i give them, as a parent, who reads to his daughter every night.  because she likes them, not because they're a joy to read aloud....

averages out to 3.25 stars.... moving on now...

from a work of fantasy, for kids old enough to follow the story lines, these are great.
(though i'm not looking forward to reading the last book to my five year old...)

you've got magical paintings and wardrobes that transport average kids to fantastic places; wonderful creatures like fauns and dryads and elves; talking mice that kick ass;  kids being transported from their mundane real lives to...well...narnia, where they have exciting adventures and become kings and queens and good triumphs...

as i wrote the above, i wanted to be able to listen to the stories unfold from the point of view of a small child again.  i bet i'd get a big kick out of them.

but as an adult, reading them for myself, i found lewis' writing to be dry, at times heavy handed, and perhaps lacking in the tone that one would hope to associate with a writer of children's books about magical kingdoms populated by talking animals and centaurs and giants and wood nymphs.

as an adult, i can roll my eyes a bit at the not-so-subtle aslan-as-god,stuff.  really rolled 'em at the end of the last battle....
as an adult, reading them to myself, i did not fight against the urge to skim like crazy, when i realized i wouldn't miss anything intrinsic to the storyline by doing so.
i embraced the urge.

as an adult reading them aloud, i find myself editing a bit.  example from last night at bedtime: does it negatively impact the story if my five year old doesn't know that the calormen are dark skinned, cruel turban-wearers?  of course not.  she's smart enough to get that they're not ""the good guys"", without that description.
is there a point at all to the stop at the island where they ousted governor gumpas?

and i find myself stumbling on occasion as i read aloud, due to lewis' writing style.  if you need parentheses to explain something that you can't show,something that's usually not that important to begin with.... don't bother.

but, again, the intended audience for these books is not me. not middle aged un-relgious guy in 2013.

it's children.
and in that respect, the books succeed, even if i personally think there are better, more excitingly written, alternatives.","3.25 stars, and a perspective that spans 35 years...",1365379200,A2ZO9D2RMMLHDP,Patrick Murray

6317,1,"if this were a review for any of the seven narnia books, you would see 4 stars (the horse and his boy; magician's nephew) or 5 stars (the other 5 books).  but this is a review of the box set, and my one-star is based on one and only one thing -- the order is wrong.

you will hear people say that the order of this box set is the order lewis intended (and how they know that is beyond me).  you will hear others say that it does not make sense to give 1 star to such excellent books simply because you ""don't agree"" with the order.  so i'll keep this simple:

1) the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe assumes that narnia is a new, novel, and unexpected place.  the reader is to be as suprised by its existence as are the characters in the book.  this is an integral element of the book and part of what makes it an all-time classic.  if you read magician's nephew first, you absolutely lose the novelty of narnia when you read the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe.

2) if magician's nephew had been the first book, this series may have never made it to a second book.  as part of the series, magician's nephew is a good book in its proper place because it takes you, in retrospect, back to the beginning of narnia.  but as a standalone, and especially the first book of a series, magician's nephew is weak.  the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, however, is arguably the strongest of the 7 and therefore the book to read in its true first position in order to kindle your interest in narnia.

3) note the age of the earthly characters in each book.  if read in the proper order (tltwatw first), the series follows a natural age progression -- growing with the reader if you will.  if you read the magician's nephew first, you begin with a series for 13-year-olds that regresses to a series for 8-year-olds and then slowly progresses to end with something appropriate for 14-year-olds.

6342,4,"setting: 5/5

lewis does a great job of establishing setting. his descriptions are vivid and make you feel as if you are actually in the story exploring alongside diggory and polly. there was never a moment where i found myself wondering where we were or what it looked like.

characters: 3/5

this was the weakest area for me simply because the characters seem to be one of the twelve common archetypes. there really wasn't enough development for me to see past the roles each character was created to fill. don't get me wrong i enjoyed the characters, especially the hilarious uncle andrew, they just didn't have much substance.  then again it is a children's book so this isn't all that unusual. i just wish children's books could be a tad more sophisticated.

plot: 4/5

this was a grand adventure! we, as the reader, had the opportunity to explore one small row of houses located in our own world and then were able to be transported into a place that could take us to an infinite amount of other worlds, some of which we explored. we hit a few bumps along the way but were able to witness the creation of a new world. how many people can say that? that's a fantastic plot. the only thing that irritates me is that more worlds weren't explored via the wood between worlds. why did we visit hardly anything? lewis created this fantastic opportunity and then just dropped the ball! oh well. i'll just be left wondering, what if.

writing:5/5

i really enjoyed lewis' writing. his narrations are written in such a way that you feel as if you are sitting down with him in front of a warm fire and he is telling you this marvelous story. every so often he stops and takes a sip of hot chocolate and adds an aside to his tale. there is no shortage of humor, which is always necessary for a good time. i think he is a great storyteller.",a marvelous adventure for both adults and children,1359676800,AQW3C1QOR6MV8,Emma

6352,3,"i love to read books because i can create a picture in my mind, but this is one of those books of the series that i watched the movie first as well as the lion the witch and the wardrobe.  however, the difference between the two:  the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe book and movie were quite similar.  this book, not so much.  but the movie, was more thrilling of an adventure.

for instance, if you have watched the voyage of the dawn treader, you would know that eustace was a dragon beyond the island of dragons, and wasn't changed back until they reached the furthest point east.  also, you would know that at the land of the dufflepuds i believe, lucy had to say a magic spell to make the house appear.  she also read a spell for snow in the movie, as well as tore out a page from the book for a ""beauty"" spell, so that she would look more like susan. another common thread throughout the movie was that each of them were warned that they would face temptation, and the white witch appeared to edmund at one of the islands towards the end of the movie, where trouble was in the book, but didn't mention the white witch amongst temptation.  finally, we know that prince caspian, although he didn't go further with lucy, edmund, reepicheep or eustace, also came to the furthest point east to meet with aslan, along with them, while his seagoing crew waited aboard the ship, but after reepicheep went on to be in aslan's land (heaven i believe) and lucy and edmund went home to find aslan (god) in other ways, as well as eustace (whom aslan said we may need you yet in the movie but not the book), prince caspian returned to the dawn treader, to return to narnia, and rule narnia as aslan so wished.

so as much as i like reading the book, and there are several spiritual connections for a parent to explain to a child, this is a book i was disappointed in as far as a more challenging adventure is concerned.  it just seemed weak.  however, the movie definitely brought the book to life where life seemed void in the book.  i am not suggesting not to read the book.  however, i am suggesting that maybe you should watch the movie after you read the book, so that you won't be let down if you read the book after having watched the movie (which seems to be the case most of the time after we have read a book, and we are disappointed with the movie; this time it is vice versa).  happy reading!","the movie added more effects, making it better.....",1358294400,A1PQ9XPPU873GB,NICOLE S

the common theme in this book seems to be that the majority of the folk and creatures only believe what they see, and many common myths (like ghosts) that were created, passed down, and re-created.  although the children believed in the magical world of narnia, and aslan as well, the older children had doubts. what lucy saw, they did not, so they kept pushing forward, instead of following the lead that aslan gave to lucy early on in their adventure to help prince caspian. however, after the adventure through the wardrobe, edmund was more inclined to believe lucy. and so most of the other creatures of narnia also had their doubts. for instance, i believe tumpkin (a hedgehog) said he believed either aslan or the white witch (whoever would help them defeat miraz, and help prince caspian in battle.

prince caspian, the second novel written and published and subtitled ""the return to narnia"", is the first of the so-called ""caspian trilogy"".  explicitly written as the ""second"" book in the series, ""prince caspian"" shows a much different narnia from the one we first saw in ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"".  hundreds of years have passed, and it is actually in the era of caspian that the most books of narnia occur.

essentially the story is that a young prince, a human descended from pirates who found their way into narnia via cave in the south pacific, is heir to the throne of narnia.  the humans have taken over narnia and have treated all the talking animals and creatures as mythological.  in this milieu, prince caspian loves the stories and early histories of ""old narnia"", who is taught to him by dr. cornelius.  eventually, he discovers that old narnia is indeed true history, and not only that, dr. cornelius is not what he first appears to be.

""prince caspian"", in the actual method of story telling, is the most different of the chronicles as a good portion of the first half of the book does not actually happen in the real time of the tale, but is instead recounted to the children by trumpkin the dwarf. from it we learn the unusual occurrences that have taken place since they have been gone, and we also come to the first book of what i of as the caspian trilogy. caspian's time frame gets the most treatment of lewis, where the beginning of the world gets one book, the golden age two books, caspian's lifetime three books, and then the ending of both the series and narnia as one book.

there are many ties in with caspian and shakespeare's hamlet. both are the rightful kings, both have uncles who are trying to kill them, and both must attempt to regain the throne. caspian is successful, but he must place the belief in a supernatural world. like hamlet who must accept advice from the ghost of his father, so must caspian place his belief in the older world to take his rightful place as king caspian the xi.

we also get directions from aslan that, even if the crowd does not do what is right, we have the responsibility to do what we know is right. instead of following aslan when she knows she should, lucy disobeys him and goes with the her siblings and the dwarf (a.k.a. d. l. f. -- dear little friend). this scene in prince caspian illustrates the fact that you should not go with the crowd when god has told you what to do. your responsibility is to aslan, not the crowd. instead of following aslan she disobeys him and goes with the crowd. it is a positive message lewis sends to his young readers about resisting peer pressure, because in the end you do not answer to this crowd but you answer to god..

we also get the theme of the dwarfs as being for the dwarfs. nikabrick, who cares for no one but the ones with power who will aid the dwarves, does not bear any love for aslan. he would just as soon be with the white witch, and indeed he brings evil beings into caspian's councils, after which he is killed. his story is a sad story, and from this we get the theme that, even though it seems there are no friends for us, in the end god will take care us if we allow him, but if we do not god will not force himself upon us.

prince caspian stands as one of the most interesting of the chronicles for the relationship it shows between god and hnau, especially that remark about god getting bigger as we grow older. we also get several of the pagan elements in this text too, and how, although the greeks and romans used it in the wrong sense, god does indeed approve of revelry and that wild passion so intensely felt, for how could it be otherwise? if god did not approve of that passion, he would not have sent jesus to die for us, because it is borne of that passion that jesus came to die.

------------------------------
[this is a brief paper i wrote about how lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]

lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. the five works this essay will look at are ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"", ""prince caspian"", ""the voyage of the dawn treader"", ""the silver chair"", and ""the last battle"". not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.

in the first book, lww, we have edmond who has become a traitor. edmond does not wish to believe that the witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. this is one of the biggest truths that lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. when the beavers are discussing aslan, edmond does not like the conversation. he feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of turkish delight. like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and lewis says at the beginning of chapter ix that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. he is so focused on his addictions that edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the white witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. even in this degraded state of mind, edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the white witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. for truth to come to edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and aslan must die for him. aslan and edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, lewis does tell us that edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.

in prince caspian, lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. caspian learns from his nurse that there is an older narnia where talking animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed narnia has their home. his uncle miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a dr. cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. it is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to ford, caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. caspian must decide which ""truth"" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about old narnia. this ties into lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. i highly doubt that, if a person is on aslan's side (although caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. lewis talks of this in his pilgrim's regress, and it is god's prime instrument in conversion. people long for something true, and unless they are deceived by satan, they will find their answer in jesus christ. it is also important to note the relationship between dr. cornelius and prince caspian. god wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for god in someone else's life, and that is why he tells us to go make disciples of men. one reason lewis chose dr. cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. sometimes, as christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek god to know who we should share it with. of course, this does not apply to america yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. as the world progresses, however, i fear that will change. once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which prince caspian does, and then becomes king caspian.

eustace scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. much of the first half of the novel eustace is a perfect ass.

jill also encounters truth in the silver chair. at the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach god, and these ways are not satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to eustace as a method of getting into narnia was. she also learns in that opening scene with her and aslan more of the nature of god. you cannot put god in a box, and aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the lion tells her that there is no other stream. throughout there rest of the novel jill learns that no matter what god says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of harfang, god will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.

perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in the last battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. farsight, the eagle, notices that rishda tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of shift's destruction. his discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and rishda is shocked that tash even exists. lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of tash was a cultural practice that rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.

although some reviewers are horrified at the treatment of susan in this book, lewis is merely expounding on his own theological beliefs, and its not quite as cold-blooded as it might appear to some people who are not familiar with certain christian belief systems.  i was a little more aghast at the now obvious racist overtones in his descriptions of the calormene enemy. i think the author, if he were alive, would gladly allow an edited version to be released that was not so obviously prejudiced.  i am sure c.s. lewis was a great guy, but sadly, just a product of his times; as we all are.",the last battle is the least of the chronicles of narnia books,1341792000,A3I9DM8V0M6U6H,Glenn Gallagher

6455,3,"lewis does a good job when he writes the passage where the children don't all see the lion the same time, only the youngest does and then the next youngest...  and that the older children sometimes don't believe the younger for petty reasons.  but, at many other times, the general reader seems to suffer because lewis is writing for children, and his analogies often suffer from oversimplification.

one of lewis's early failings is that he tries to make too much hay out of his talking animal analogy.  all religions have their miracles, and some are said to have happened relatively recently.  this does not mean that all reports of miracles are true, or that everything in the bible without exception was meant to be taken literally.

but there are other flaws.  prominently, at the end of this book, lewis, falls prey to the sloppy writing habits concomittant to most serials.  out of seemingly nowhere, he adds a long list of nameless and faceless, one-dimensional characters and quickly condemns them.  what he doesn't do is write anything about them that would make us believe that they have souls.  among them, a bunch of mischevious schoolboys suddenly turn into swines, and lewis is the circe who transforms them.  there's no charity here: he is condemning children, in mass, without us even meeting them.

this is not the christian spirit, and the oversimplification present in his analogy is often galling.",lewis as circe,1328745600,A1TRH2JALWQ6I0,A Critic
6458,3,"i'm beginning to see why high fantasy almost always takes place on an epic scale. the short volumes of the chronicles of narnia don't really give you a chance to live in the world and experience it. prince caspian is at its most winning when it revels in the past. when the children return to narnia, they discover a world that has aged for a thousand years without them. it gave the place a feeling of weight and grandeur before the plot caught up with them.

like lww, pc is a slight narrative heading towards a single, swift, decisive battle that will be easily won by aslan after taking a moment to meditate on faith and god. the main thrust of the story is about restoring prince caspian to the throne of narnia, usurped by his murderous uncle claudius--i mean, miraz. his plight is what summons the four children back to narnia, and his backstory is the subject of a four-chapter flashback. no, really. this is only a fifteen chapter book. roughly a quarter of the narrative is a single, unbroken flashback that doesn't involve any of the four children we're supposed to be following. this is not the least of the narrative issues i have with pc, but overall the book did surpass lww. it was more engaging and the ending was less of a deus ex machina.

also, the heroes are less useless in this book. susan gets to use her bow (although she still isn't allowed to participate in combat). peter and edmund get their diplomacy on, but none of them have much of an arc. and lucy... she is the main character of a lewis-gets-preachy unnecessary subplot that really bothered me. not because i'm anti-allegory (i'm not) and not because i'm anti-religion (i am, but i'm claiming objectivity), but because i hate sacrificing narrative cohesion for the sake of making an unnecessary point. while the group is trying to find caspian, aslan appears to lucy and lucy alone, bidding her to follow him. she mentions this to the group, but she's outvoted. the following night, she sees aslan again, who seems to be irked that she didn't convince the others to follow him or, failing that, follow alone. he could have just appeared to all four children and been done with it. but instead, he chose to admonish the faithless for exercising otherwise sound judgement.

i realize that for lewis, this was probably meant to be a deep homily on the nature of faith. for me, it just points out what a jerk aslan (and by extension god) can be. in case you hadn't picked up on this, i don't enjoy aslan as a character. he shows up, bosses people around, and everyone thinks he's awesome. but aside from swooping in at the last minute to win battles, he doesn't do much apart from being mysterious and unapproachable. think about it, he's almost completely unnecessary to the plot. his presence diminishes the actions of the children--who are the heroes of the story. he heals people and he rallies the troops, but he mostly just exists for lewis to fawn over. this book (and its predecessor) could have been told without his physical presence, losing the painfully plot-halting allegory and making the heroes' deeds more heroic. would have made for better books, in my opinion.

on the whole, i liked pc more than lww. it felt lived in, more self-assured. i'm looking forward to where this series goes, but i've had it up to here with the darned lion.",would've been better without the lion,1327968000,A2TYXDDR7U35HO,Kurt Joseph Pankau

i understand the story is supposed to be scattered all over the place since the children are island hopping but i think because each incident at each island was rounded out so nicely that it was more noticeable for me. i guess i just wasn't as enchanted with this story as i was with the previous ones. thahb is still my favorite in the series at this point and i think eustace really irked me to the point of not enjoying this one and wanting to drown him in the ocean they were sailing on. he was a pain in the ass. i would have liked to seen him change (character, not shape) as opposed to getting told he was a different person after the dragon thing but such is this and the rest of the stories.

and aslan appearing to the children as a lamb . . . even i think that's getting beaten over the head with the jesus references. not to mention him saying that he's known by another name in our world and the children will have to know him by that name. hmmm . . . is it horatio? not that that's a bad thing but the religious references are becoming more and more obvious as the series goes on.

6504,5,"have you ever been afraid? i mean, deathly, horribly, afraid? not of the dark, or being hurt in sports or rock-climbing, or some other concrete fear, but of something more *ephemeral*? the answer is that, yes, we all have. it may have been fear of giving a speech, or singing in front of an audience, or of being laughed at by a girl that you wish to impress (or a boy that you wish to impress for the ladies). for christians, it is somewhat deeper of a fear, and this is the real message of c. s. lewis' *the chronicles of narnia: prince caspian*.

in the book, the four pevensies, peter, susan, edmund, and lucy, are called into narnia by susan's magic horn she received from father christmas in the first book. a young boy, heir to the throne of his telmarine ancestors who conquered narnia several hundred years after the children returned to england, wanted to take the throne from his murderous uncle, miraz, and reopen narnia to the talking beasts and other creatures of aslan that originally dwelt there.

he and the narnians are, of course, outclassed militarily by the humans on miraz's side, and their more sophisticated (at least to the narnians), though crude and of less quality, weapons. it is at this point that king caspian blows susan's horn, and the four children are pulled into narnia.

the book is a darker and less fanciful tale than *the lion, the witch and the wardrobe*. the children do not have nearly such a fine time as they did on their first trip to narnia, not until the very end at least. whereas the earlier visit was a time of great personal blessing as well as responsibility, this was a time of hard work, with very little reward. at least this seems to be the case.

although aslan still does the main work of saving the day, the children and the ""old narnians"", lead by caspian, are in the very brutal situation of having to kill an opposing army that is not *all* bad and villainous like the white witch's army was in the original book. this was made clear enough by the fact that a large minority of the adult telmarines chose to stay under caspian's rule in narnia, and even among the majority who left, there were some who were noble.

indeed, one could argue that this similarity to real-world warfare makes the book the ""darkest"" of the narnian chronicles, save for perhaps the final installment. of seemingly lesser degree, but greater importance, is the struggle for faith in aslan with which the children and trumpkin the dwarf must contend.

at first none but lucy can see aslan, but he is there, and scolds lucy for giving into the others, and then badmouthing them behind their backs. instead, she must face up to their doubts in her and anger at her. she must follow aslan, and hopefully they will, as well. all of this puts peter, susan, and trumpkin against her. edmund is a bit cold towards her, but this is just his nerves, as he really does support her.

at the end, there is a short celebration, and then the children are sent home, with peter and susan told they will never return to narnia. this seems like a pretty pathetic reward for their hard work and service. in the grand scheme of things, it is not, for aslan (as god) knows what is best for them all, and has more great things in store for them. indeed, though susan will later deny aslan and narnia, she is likely still saved by the faith the four children found in christ, aslan's person and name in our world.

you see, in the cosmology of the books, aslan gave the children the greatest gift of all by drawing them to himself, and bringing them to a faith in him in both worlds. the instrument he used was lucy, as she showed incredible faith and ability, god-given, to conquer her fears. her fears of laughter, mocking, or rejection by her siblings. afterwards, lucy and susan spread the message of aslan to others, and they followed him, and were in bliss in his glorious presence. but it was lucy's faith that made this possible in the first place.

though, as far as we know, jesus is not a giant lion in another world, the point about sharing the gospel with those who so desperately need it, still stands. this can extend to other areas as well. are we afraid to talk to others, for fear of them hurting us? do we doubt or question god's work and role in our lives, instead of asking him what he is trying to accomplish, and how we can serve him? in these areas, and so many more, we hurt ourselves, others, and most importantly of all, our relationship with god, by letting our fears govern us. in this, we sin.

this book, in it's content, and it's messages, is far more serious, and difficult, than the first narnia book, but it is well-worth it to read for enjoyment, for edification, and for seeing in vivid form, the necessity of leaning on our lord and savior jesus christ. even when others mock him as not there, and even when we can not feel his presence, he is there. he is the god who created you and me. trust him and lean on him today.

6513,3,"the third book published in the chronicles of narnia series is the voyage of the dawn treader.  as with the movie version, the book version of voyage of the dawn treader runs the bases of catholic moral teaching fairly well.  each major encounter at sea seems to be at least an examination of one of the major sins that we all believe in.  a couple of them even go to the trouble of showing us what happens to a society that succumbs to the sin in question.

the slaver trader island with the lazy governor and mindless beaurocrasy is clearly sloth, and its inhabitants were too lazy to stop the slave trade that popped up in it, as well as to do anything about it when they were ""conquered.""  the battle with the sea serpent; only winnable by not fighting, seems like a message about wrath.  vanity (a close cousin to lust) dominates the predicaments found on the isle of the monopods, and deathwater is obviously a place of greed.  however, the others are a bit harder to interpret than this.

people are tempted towards the island where dreams come true, out of envy of what others have, and the island with the banquet, where proper conduct around the food is required seems like it might be a message about gluttony.  the lesson about pride, however, is more widespread, and found on most islands.  it could be the dragon island, but that isle seemed to have as much to do with greed as with pride, if not more so, so the allegories are a bit muddled on this point.

apart from this surface-allegory, the overall flow of the narrative covers a few other things as well.  reepicheep's quest is to reach the edge of the world, and not return, because he knows that he'll find happiness there.  this is a bit like our own quests to reach heaven, although i admit that it comes off as a bit selfish when translated into fiction, if only because it's not obvious that reepicheep will still be able to help them from the other side.  this is one of the things that i would probably change about the story if i could.

on top of this, something happens to eustace on dragon island, which involves a bath, which aslan must help with, in order to cure him of his evil, which is a clear baptism reference.  this pivotal element was left out of the movie, and it's one of the few pieces of the book that i'll say that about.

here's the problem that i had with this book.  as i said in my review of the movie, there's no overarching villain to the piece, so the nature of the threats they run into are really more disjointed and unrelated than in previous books of the series, and i just didn't find it as exciting.  it just helps for a piece to have a villain, i feel, which combined with some of the more indistinct allegories, accounts for the low enjoyability score i gave it.

i've heard it said, however, that many people liked this book best out of the whole series.  i admit to having a hard time understanding why.  without the presence of a strong villain to outline what's good about the heroes, the whole flow of the story really loses something important.  you may notice me mentioning this element in some of the other books as an overall weakness, but i'm sorry.  i just can't get over this.  i really do feel that threatening villains are that important to any story.

did i hate this story?  no.  did i enjoy it?  well, not as much as prince caspian, but yes; i did.  a few of the problems that the crew runs into are at least interesting, but in my opinion, it's far from the best of the series, nor does it broadcast the clearest messages.  i do suggest you read it, because you might like it more than i did, but it may be a while before i read it again.  i just don't think there was as much to this story as there should have been.",allegories and villains...,1308009600,A120V3RVSK1O1K,K.

6515,2,"my daughter and i finished reading this book tonight, and with three pages to go, she asked me, ""who is caspian?"" i think that says it all. she loved the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, but caspian barely held her attention. i really disliked it myself. the action is extremely slow to get going, and indeed, there isn't much action at all until the end of the book.

the story is that peter, edmund, susan, and lucy are whisked back to narnia, and although only a year has passed in earth time, an unknown amount of time (hundreds, maybe thousands of years) have passed in narnia. the first two chapters are extremely boring, as the foursome arrive in narnia (although they don't know that it is narnia) and muddle about. then they meet a dwarf who tells a story about prince caspian, and we're ""treated"" to a story within a story told to caspian by his tutor. it was all very confusing, especially for my four-year-old. the next thing you know, we're back in present time, and there still hasn't been much action. ultimately, there is a one-on-one sword fight between high king peter and the evil king miraz, which ends in what is basically a riot. that was decently exciting, but even the duel is relayed in the most boring fashion possible, with the other characters explaining what has happened after it has happened.

prince caspian is an extremely minor figure in the book. ""king caspian"" is the moniker used more often. his uncle, king miraz, has usurped his throne. that's two kings. then there's king peter, and of course, aslan, the king of kings. this was very confusing to my daughter. further confusing is how peter duels miraz so that caspian can be king. the thing i liked best about the book is how edmund redeems himself. what i liked least about it was everything else. now it is up to my daughter to choose what book we read next, and i secretly hope she gives up on the narnia series. the first book had a sense of wonder, but this was bland, violent, and really (in my opinion) rather pointless.",who is caspian?,1307836800,A3F00QUIXGDTOW,Dawn-Marie
6516,3,"the second published book in the chronicles of narnia series was prince caspian; and i have to admit, it didn't make much of an impression on me the first time i read it.  that perspective has since changed, though i still feel that there are many weaknesses in the writing of the story, which should be pointed out.

for one thing, the tale is divided into a number of sections, which differ drastically from one another, meaning that the narrative doesn't exactly flow.  there are, i think, five distinct sections, each very different from the others.  the arrival of the children, the backstory of caspian, the journey towards aslan's how, the battle with miraz, and the victories of aslan; the last being perhaps the most jarring and bizarre of the five, although there's obviously a reason for that.

the first section of the tale; the arrival of the children, is largely set-up for the story.  not much is said or done of any consequence, other than a brief exploration of the area they've found themselves in, and a realization of where they are.  they eventually meet a dwarf, who initiates the second section.

caspian's backstory is fairly interesting.  we find out that king miraz (who's actually a usurper; not the real king,) and his people; the telmarines (basically human beings,) have pretty much taken control of the land away from its native peoples, and have been trying to erase even the records of their past existence.  it's only through testimony by his nurse, and a half-dwarf that caspian even learns about the mythical beasts who once peopled narnia at all.

this section of the story is perhaps the most disturbing if read by itself.  the reason is that a few protestant communities genuinely believe that the real ""church"" was suppressed by the catholic church, and all records of it destroyed; a belief only supported by individual preachers, who arose in the last century and a half or so.  one might easily conclude, at first, that miraz is meant to be an allegory for the modern catholic church, and therefore, that this book is blatantly anti-catholic, but i don't consider that likely, and i'll explain why in just a moment.

the third section of the book is basically the kids and the dwarf wandering in the wilderness, in search of aslan's how, where caspian awaits.  in my opinion, this section drags on a bit too long, but at least its message is quite clear; when aslan (god) tells you to go someplace, you do it.

the setup is this; to get where they need to be, the children need to get across a gorge, so they try to explore a bit and see if there's some route around it; some place where they could cross.  aslan wants them to go one way, and lucy warns them about this, but none of the others saw him.  they wind up getting themselves lost in the woods for a while, and nearly killed by the enemy, before turning back and going aslan's way; across the gorge by a series of solid rocks that they hadn't been able to see at first.

sometimes, the answer to our problems is right in front of us, but the path just seems too difficult or dangerous.  we take account of the wind and the waves, and forget to keep our eyes on the one person who truly matters.  in retrospect, this may have been the high point of the story.

in section four, some of caspian's men betray him, and try to summon the white witch, but they're killed before they can complete their spell.  caspian refuses to be a part of any of their black magic, trusting in aslan, even though he hasn't shown up yet.  peter and the other kids do show up, however, and peter offers to fight miraz in single combat.

this is the point where the anti-catholic accusations are handily disarmed.  peter is clearly an allegory for saint peter; the first pope, and all successive popes by extension, and miraz, as i've said already, is clearly not a real king (not a real pope,) but a usurper (a heretic.)  in many ways, the battle between peter and miraz has more of the tone of athanasius against arius or the iconoclast heresy than the catholic church vs protestants, but regardless, the fact remains that if lewis had meant this to be an allegory for an accusation against the church, he would probably have had someone other than peter battle miraz, and definitely wouldn't have kept referring to miraz as a usurper of the throne.  miraz is a heretic who needs to be put into his place.  that's how i read this allegory, which might as well be a history of the early church.

the victories of aslan are sprinkled throughout and past the fourth section, but are so drastically different from it, that i list them separately anyway.  of course, the wrapping up of the story is left to aslan, as always, but there's also a very strange scene, where he trapses through a town with a crowd of magical folks, and starts magically transforming it back into old narnia.  desks and walls turn into bushes and trees, very good people join his side, and very evil people metamorph into brute animals or plants.  the entire scene is simultaneously whimsical and gruesome; a rare feat in a book like this, and the reason for this is obvious; god (aslan) divides people just like this.  to the just, he's a dream come true.  to the wicked, he's their worst nightmare.

the allegories are harder to read in prince caspian than they were in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, and i didn't really enjoy the book as much; the main reason being that it wasn't as exciting.  the white witch was an everpresent and menacing figure (at least at first.)  miraz is only in a couple of scenes, and even then, makes only a very small impression on the readers.  somehow, i just don't think that lewis enjoyed writing villains, though he could do so competently if he needed to.  i just don't feel he did that here.

regardless, this book is fair material for catholics to read, though, as i said, not as good as the first.  it's not all that exciting for the most part, but it has some fairly good things to say.",the catholic perspective; allegories in narnia,1307750400,A120V3RVSK1O1K,K. Ostrowski
6527,3,"there are certainly positives to the chronicles of narnia. the main bodies of the stories are enjoyable (the openings are often dull; the ends i will treat later; i found the lion, the witch and the wardrobe to be uninteresting through and through) and they are charming. i especially liked a horse and his boy, voyage of the dawn treader and the silver chair (though i can't figure out why something that is featured for about a page and a half is the title of the entire book). one of lewis's best qualities as a writer (especially for children) is his usage of simile. he has a special ability to convey to the reader the exact sensation that a character is experiencing. his humor is also sometimes cute.

unfortunately, the writing is somewhat bland. for example, we often read about the greatness of cair paravel and life there, but very infrequently are they described in rich detail. in fact, too little in the whole series is described in rich and exciting detail, leaving narnia flat and simplistic.

the biggest flaw of the chronicles, however, is lewis's focus on his message of christian morals and trust in jesus, which often comes at the expense of the story itself. it's difficult to avoid feeling ""preached to"" when the religious allegory in the book is so overt, sometimes bordering on explicit, and that takes away from the joy of reading for experience.

one of the main no-no's of fiction is the resolution of climax by an ""act of god"". because of lewis's theme, he often resorts to an act of aslan (or something tantamount) to resolve the story question. this might make for a good lesson on faith in god, but it doesn't make for a satisfying story. and then, to make matters worse the story often drags on with its esoteric message after the tension has dissipated and the reader has lost interest. (the last battle ends with a mind-numbing three and a half chapters of this!)

i personally feel that the transporting of 20th century children to narnia and frequent narrative references to modern inventions while they are in narnia detract from the magic of the fantasy world (though in regards to eustace they make for good humor).

the series also contains a few annoying internal contradictions. the general implication throughout the books is that ""real world"" time flows slower than narnian time, as on each return to the real world after long periods in narnia, the children notice that no time has elapsed. yet, in the last battle, eustace and jill take a week of real time to get to narnia in what is for king tirian only a few moments. are there many natural entrances to narnia from the real world (prince caspian), or is the wardrobe unique because of its origins (magician's nephew), or can you just pray to be transported (silver chair)? is cair paravel a castle (see lion especially) or a city (last battle)? of course, one could find answers to these contradictions, but the real explanation is probably that lewis changed his mind or used a certain device to fit the story (like the time flow), and it is both apparent and irksome to an observant reader.

everyone seems to feel the need to comment on the correct order for reading the chronicles, so i'll do likewise. although lewis admitted in a letter that the chronological order (beginning with magician's nephew) is probably the correct order, i think it's fair to argue with him on this point because he never experienced narnia from the reader's perspective. he wrote magician's nephew assuming that you had already read lion, and lion assuming that you had no introduction to narnia yet. therefore, the feeling of mystery and discovery of lion is ruined by reading nephew first. i recommend reading lion and prince caspian first, and then nephew and horse, thereby retaining the feeling of discovery of the first two books, while still staying close to the chronological order.

(there is one more issue that i would like to comment on. there are those who have labeled lewis as sexist because of the following statement in the last battle: ""oh susan!"" said jill. ""she's interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations. she always was a jolly sight too keen on being grown-up."" i think that it is clear from an honest look at the context and the general theme of the series that sexism was not lewis's intent. the next statement is ""grown-up, indeed,"" said the lady polly. ""i wish she would grow up. she wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can."" lewis's point is that christian values are superior to materialism. susan is being portrayed as a materialistic skeptic  [""yes,"" said eustace, ""and whenever you've tried to get her to come and talk about narnia or do anything about narnia, she says, `what wonderful memories you have! fancy your still thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children.'""] and she loses out on the final experience of the other ""friends of narnia"" [i.e. good, believing christians]. that and only that was lewis's intent, not to stereotype women as shallow. did he portray lucy, jill and polly that way?)",narnia is a mixed bag,1302739200,A3EPLGT8E2OJY4,D.

6529,3,"written subsequently as a prequel to the acclaimed and beloved narnia series, this book proves a delightful story about the first two children who meet aslan.  their adventures between worlds set in motion a chain of events which reenact the age old conflict of good versus evil, but in a gentle, unsophisticated literary style.  very readable this book offers much dialogue, delightful sketches and the author's mild and amusing observations on human nature and 1950's british society.

 meeting over a mutual property garden wall polly and digory decide to explore the unused attic passageways that connect many houses on their street.  blundering into an otherwise locked study of the boy's uncle, they are faced by moral decisions which catapault them into magical adventures. charmed by a special ring polly tries it on and instantly is whisked into another--unknown--dimension.  a morla coward uncle andrew forces digory to follow her to effect a rescue, but he himself has no idea what insanity and peril will be unleashed as result of his amateurish meddling.

 polly and digory, arguing the while, explore the dying world of charn until they are captured by the ruthless queen, who has been released from her stone spell by the ringing of the bell.  after accidentally bringing her to modern london where she wreaks havoc in her lusty for domination, the kids escape to the woods between the worlds, with evil jadis
physically accompanying them.  when the three step out into a world of nothingness, they witness the creation of a totally new world, from the power of music--specifically the lion's song.  for it is aslan who willfully launches this new land of narnia, overseeing the creation of all species according to his master plan.  yet he is fully cognizant of the evil which has escaped to blight this world in the future--and of the price he will have to pay to save it.(the last battle).

 c.s. lewis includes many christian parallels and themes, as digory is sent on a morally dangerous mission to retrieve an apple from the sacred garden. the confused boy just wants to save his dying mother, but aslan's priorities seem to be solely for narnia.  from the founding of a royal dynasty, to the ever shining lamp post near the forest gateway, and even the building of the famous wardrobe itself---all the pieces are now in place to launch this children's series--for kids of all ages! charming!",how narnia began!,1301875200,A1SER5HLPRY6SB,Gale Finlayson

edmund and lucy pevensie are staying with their cousin, eustace scrubb, a nasty little boy with no imagination.  one day, while admiring a painting of a narnia-esque ship in one of their aunt's rooms, the trio are whisked inside the painting and set upon the dawn treader, king caspian's ship.  his quest?  to find out what happened to seven lords that miraz had sent out to explore the eastern sea.

i liked:
this book was a joy to listen to again.  i had forgotten so much, and, now that i'm older, certain scenes meant a whole lot more to me now.
firstly, we have eustace scrubb, who is a perfectly unpleasant boy.  i love how he rubs people the wrong way, how much of a stick-in-the-mud he is, and his entire character arc.  his struggle being the dragon and having to rely on someone else to return to human form are some of the best pieces of christian allegory in the entire series.  as aslan helped him out of the dragon skin, i was nearly in tears.  the scenes were well-written and definitely not clubbing christian ideology over your head.
other characters were good too.  edmund is always amusing, and i did love the part where he bickers with caspian over the rule of narnia.  caspian is much more enjoyable and active; lewis did a good job ""growing him up"".  even reepicheep, who will never be my favorite character, was far more interesting here than in his debut novel, prince caspian.
i love the adventure story, the traveling to all the foreign, unexplored islands, and how different each one was.  the island of dreams was haunting, almost horror-like (without being too scary for the little ones this was meant for); the island of gold was enlightening; the island of the dufflepods was interesting.  each place showed something new about the characters and their personality and growth.
i adored the humor, or should i say, light-hearted tone of the book.  the book didn't stay very dark and plenty of the characters made jokes throughout.

i didn't like:
first thing i didn't like (unfortunately) was the narrator's voice for reepicheep.  yes, i understand the character is a mouse, but listening to a squeaky, high-pitched voice is not what i had in mind.
while most of the allegory is tamed down, i still wasn't fond of the deus ex aslan.  every time the characters encounter something, aslan immediately steps in and takes away all of the conflict.  for instance, at the island of the gold pond (not the real name, my name), edmund and caspian begin to argue over the rule of narnia.  almost instantly, aslan appears, wipes their memories, and the kids are like, ""huh, what were we doing?  mmm, must not be important, let's leave.""  what a way to remove any possibility for character growth!

dialogue/sexual situation/violence:
none.
caspian gets married at the end of the book.
there are a few battles, one between edmund and caspian, one amongst slavers, and one with a sea creature.

overall:
this was a very enjoyable novel.  i loved traveling on the ship with the children as they explored the unknown.  even the narrator's voice for reepicheep and the evaporating conflict can't get rid of the good feelings i have finishing this book.

peter, susan, edmund, and lucy are sitting at the train station waiting for their train when whoosh! they are back in narnia! narnia is now under the rule of evil miraz, but there is one who wants to return it to its former glory: prince caspian.

i liked:
once again, i find myself at a loss to describe my feelings towards this book.
the story was interesting and didn't try to recreate the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe. i liked how the emphasis was taken off the race of people, but their hearts (miraz was bad, not because he was telmarene, but because he was truly evil; caspian was good because he wanted to restore rights to the citizens of narnia not because he was human). also, for those who weren't gung ho about the heavy christian allegory, take heart! prince caspian still has christian themes, but it is nowhere nears as obvious as in the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe.
i liked some of the growth we see in the four children. peter hasn't really changed that much--he is still the take charge eldest, but susan has a hint of what is to come and while i don't like where her character is going, i do appreciate the foreshadowing. edmund has really matured; i think the scenes where he is the only one to back up lucy were very poignant especially in light of his actions in the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe. and even lucy doesn't come off as the epitome of perfection, which i appreciated.
as always, lewis continues to describe his land beautifully and populate it with interesting beings. i liked how cair paravel had become deserted and the landscape of narnia had changed drastically.
and since i listened to this on audiobook, i wanted to commend lynn redgrave on the narrating. i'll admit, i wasn't fond of all the voices she used, but her voice was definitely gentle on the ears.

i didn't like:
it's funny; as i relisten to these books, i begin to recall how when i first heard them (in my teens) i thought they were boring and dull. in many ways, over a dozen years later, my thoughts really haven't changed.
a large portion of prince caspian is spent in the dreaded flashback. four chapters are basically a story a dwarf tells the four children about caspian. i am just not fond of this device; if it is that important, it needs to be shown not retold (and yes, lord of the rings has the similar problem with the chapter that never ends, ""elrond's council""). it would have been much better, in my opinion, to just tell caspian's story then have the children transport to narnia (somewhat how the movie did it).
storywise, not a whole lot happens. yet again, the children tend to be mostly bystanders in the conflict or the catalyst instead of actively getting involved. this isn't as bad as the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, as peter does have a duel with miraz, but most of the conflict is resolved in the end by aslan's appearance. i'm still not quite sure what the point of having the children there was in the first place. a lot of the story is hampered with prince caspian visiting all these animals, explaining his claim to the throne, and them immediately saying, ""i'm on board!"" absolutely no tension whatsoever.
another thing i didn't care for was the almost complete lack of conflict. peter has no trouble handing off the crown to caspian. caspian immediately believes all the stories about narnia and has no troubles with four monarchs returning to help him. the ""good"" animals jump immediately at the chance to join caspian's army. the conflict about lucy seeing aslan was one of the few exceptions and was welcome. i think it's possible to write a novel for young people without dumbing down the character interactions and taking away all complexities.

dialogue/sexual situations/violence:
none.
caspian's aunt has a baby.
peter has a duel with miraz; there are several battles, but if you blink, you'll miss them.

overall:
this is going to sound weird, but i found prince caspian boring and interesting at the same time. interesting story told in a boring way. however, that is for a jaded almost 30 year old; maybe if i had read this as a young child or was reading to a young child, i wouldn't overthink it. as it is, it's still a decent story and mildly entertaining.

6545,3,"the magician's nephew is the first book in the chronicles of narnia.  while it is not as well known as the others, it is the beginning, and so, a very important book for the series.

diggory and his new friend polly have been tricked into going to a different world by his somewhat mad, magician uncle.  with some magical rings they are transported to a calm forest filled with pools that lead to different worlds.  it is in one of these worlds, charn, that diggory does something terrible and awakens a beautiful but treacherous queen who demands to go back to their world with them as hers is dying.  she does manage to tag along despite their best efforts and is soon wreaking havoc on london.  as the children try to get her back, they inadvertently transport themselves, diggory's uncle, the queen, and a bystanding cabby and his horse along with them.  from there they go to an empty world.  but to their wonder this world does not remain empty for long, because a certain lion has just started singing.

the characters are very undescribed in this book.  i would have loved some back history on the evil queen and why she was the way she was.  even diggory's uncle didn't have a good basis described for being the way he was.  poor polly was more of a sidekick character and the only one who really had any real emotion was diggory himself.

the writing was decent and appropriate for children although they may not understand everything that goes on.  the story is rushed though and for it to be the beginning of a magical world, i expected a lot more to the story.  the novel does have christian tones but they are not very preachy and instead it reads as a regular fantasy novel for the most part.  especially since it includes the use of magic.

i do love the narnia tales.  while this is not the best of them, it is still very important to read as it marks the start and does explain some history of the series.  it should definitely be included in the reading list of all that is narnia.

6564,5,"the voyage of the dawn treader (1952) is a children's fantasy novel, the third in c. s. lewis's chronicles of narnia. here, edmund and lucy, along with their insufferable cousin eustace, are pulled into narnia to aid caspian in his search for seven missing narnian lords.

there isn't much of an overarching plot here as there are in lewis's prior novels; it's much more episodic, as the dawn treader sails to one island after another, and to one adventure after another. and this is why the novel works so well: lewis has given himself complete narrative freedom to do whatever he wants, and he uses the full measure of his wondrous imagination. the unexpected is here in a way unlike the previous stories, and the voyage of the dawn treader has throughout it the full and free spirit of fantasy adventure.

the voyage of the dawn treader is a more charming read than either of lewis's previous books in the series, and the primary reason is that lewis, as narrator, has gotten himself rather more playfully involved, making humorous observations here and witty comments there, in a way reminiscent of j. r. r. tolkien's the hobbit. lewis's characters' dialogue is also sharp and clever, certainly more so than in previous books. my general impression is that with this book, lewis really got a handle on his narnian storytelling.

as is usual for him, lewis has a number of moral themes at work here: most obviously, he addresses greed on a number of occasions - greed for wealth, for status, and for beauty. through eustace, lewis extols the virtues of being well-mannered and considerate of others, but he also attacks the notion that ""modern values"" are inherently superior.

christian themes are not as prominent here as in some other works (except, of course, christian virtue), but they can be found in some depth in reepicheep's quest for aslan's country - his quest, as it were, for afterlife and the kingdom of god. and this is an area of the story where lewis excels. he does a fine job of balancing childish wonderment and mature gravity in his characters as they approach the end of the world, and lewis's fleeting glimpses of what might lie beyond fire the spirit and the imagination.

the voyage of the dawn treader is an outstanding adventure novel; it might be my favorite book in the series.",the voyage of the dawn treader by c. s. lewis,1296259200,A1LMBM1N4EXS5W,MOTU Review
6569,4,"prince caspian, or, prince caspian: the return to narnia (1951) is a children's fantasy novel, the second in c. s. lewis's chronicles of narnia. here, peter, susan, edmund and lucy are drawn back to narnia, where hundreds of years have passed, and must work to overthrow a usurper and put the rightful king on the throne.

the story itself is rather straightforward: the pevensies are in narnia to do a job and get out. it's all business, and the spirit of adventure the reader finds in the best books of the series is mostly absent here; it doesn't help that the story follows the same basic structure as the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, only without most of that book's epic feel and emotional power. and yet the world of magical characters and lewis's own wit and sprinkling of profound christian principles carry the story and make it an enjoyable read in spite of its flaws.

a prominent theme in prince caspian is the virtue of faith and belief; some of the children experience degrees of doubt in aslan, and many of the narnians have lost faith in him altogether. other themes include chivalry and, as is always the case with aslan, grace.

prince caspian suffers from some storytelling issues. the novel starts with the pevensie children, follows them briefly, and then jumps to prince caspian's backstory, which takes up nearly half the novel. when the story returns to the pevensies, they spend most of their time doing little more trudging through the woods. prince caspian almost certainly would have worked better if lewis had written the whole thing from the point of view of caspian himself (along the lines of what he did with tirian in the last battle), although this would only further highlight the fact that the pevensies have very little to do throughout most of the novel (and half of what they do is squabble).

on the whole, prince caspian is probably the weakest book in the chronicles of narnia, but even so, it's still worthwhile.",prince caspian by c. s. lewis,1296172800,A1LMBM1N4EXS5W,MOTU Review
6588,1,"""the last battle"" is by far the most bizarre, fantastical and frankly twisted of the narnian chronicles.  it opens with a pair of ""friends"" - a cruel and manipulative talking ape and a gentle, none-too-bright talking donkey - who find a lion's pelt which happens to wash over a steep waterfall.  the ape cons the donkey into wearing the lion's suit he has fashioned from the pelt and pretending to be aslan.  within a matter of weeks enough supposedly intelligent free narnian talking animals have fallen for this set-up that the calormenes (in league with the ape) have taken over the lantern waste, killed the trees and enslaved the animals who have fallen for the donkey in the lion's suit.

king tirian, the last king of narnia, with the help of a last few brave and noble narnian friends attempt to fight back against the ape, the calormenes and the false aslan, but the plot has already spiraled out of the control of even the ape.  even with the help of eustace and jill, called to narnia by tirian, the small band is hopelessly outnumbered and quickly destroyed and all of narnia comes to a rather sudden and brutal end through a series of convoluted and impossible events.  but it's all okay, because they end up ... back in narnia.

oh my, where to begin?

first, there's lewis' obsession with dark skinned people as cruel savages who worship either a false god or an evil one.  this theme was beaten to death in ""the horse and his boy"", but it rears its ugly head again.  as part of the spiraling plot, the ape and the leader of the calormenes (along with other co-conspirators) have conspired to convince both the calormenes and the narnians that the gentle narnian lion-god aslan and the brutal calormene god tash are one and the same (""tashlan"").  the tarkaan doesn't even believe in tash, but in executing his plot, he inadvertently calls up the real tash who is a hideous destructive monster-beast-god, which proves to be his un-doing.  (oddly enough, a young calormene who has honestly believed in and served tash is accepted by aslan because, according to aslan, his noble service to tash was actually noble service to aslan - i wonder how the christian fundamentalists who practically canonize the narnian books reconcile that?)

but the loathsome idea that an entire race of savage dark-skinned people knowingly and willingly worship a dark and brutal false god pales in comparison to lewis' casual destruction of the world.  i understand the parallels with the destruction of the world as portrayed in the book of revelation, but lewis' portrayal is beyond the pale.  at least in revelation the world has earned god's wrath through their wickedness.  but lewis gives no such indication of the corruption or wickedness of narnia.  narnia under king tirian has, perhaps, grown complacent, but certainly not evil.  yet some crazy whim of a lone narcissistic ape is enough to set in motion events which destroy the entire narnian world - both the good and the bad.  aslan apparently has a rather peculiar sense of justice.

***spoiler alert***  it may seem that i've already given away the ending by saying that narnia is destroyed, but really that's pretty obvious from almost the beginning of the book.  i don't usually discuss the endings of books i review, but i can't let this one pass.  the ending of the narnian world is all justified and ameliorated because all of the good and noble narnians from the whole of narnian history find themselves together again in aslan's country, which apparently is the ""real"" narnia.  so you see, death and destruction don't really mean anything because all the good people simply go to their ""real"" home with aslan.

also in aslan's country, we find the pevensie children as well as digory and polly from ""the magician's nephew"".  now, you may recall, the pevensie children were already told that they would not be returning to narnia again.  so how is it that they're there?  it's simple, really.  you see, they're dead.  there was a train accident in their own world which killed them all.  delightful, eh?  oh, but don't worry, it's not a tragedy at all, for now they are with the great and glorious aslan for all eternity!  see, death and destruction mean absolutely nothing.  now, you might think about the people they've left behind back in england (including, apparently susan who has somehow fallen out of favor because at some point she apparently stopped believing in narnia, although i don't remember that from any of the other books), but you needn't waste you energies on such trifles.  after all, everything is all in our minds anyway.

this final book of the narnia series destroys all that went before it in much the same way that the final episode of ""st. elsewhere"" destroyed everything that went before it.  it never happened.  it never existed.  it was all in the minds of eight kids, seven of whom are dead now and one a non-believer.  nothing to see here, folks, move along now.","rather horrid, really",1293580800,A2QX49LS3Y3ANI,Dienne
6593,5,"while the plot of this book may not be as cohesive as other books in the narnia series, the scenes are mental eye-candy that seem primed to explode onto a movie screen.  mysterious characters create a sense of wonder and splash elements of the bizarre into the story.  yet it is returning characters lucy, edmund, and prince caspian carry the story of a remarkable journey.

while ""dawn treader"" may lack a villain, it is the story of a journey and challenges faced on that journey.  with storylines that mirror elements of christianity, it is a reflection of the journey many people are traveling.  the story begins with lucy, edmund, and cousin eustace catching the journey already in progress.  caspian and his crew are seeking the seven lost lords of narnia.  new lands reveal new fates, and add a new dimensions to the plot.  while the change in eustace may be a predictable part of the journey, it is still amusing to read.  other surprises may catch the reader off guard.

though the book stretches the boundaries of fiction at times, the c.s. lewis closes the story nicely.  the ending is particularly pleasant for those that had trouble wrapping their brains around certain scenes.

i first read the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe when i was four or five years old. it was part of a ""great books for kids"" set my parents got. (it was my second-favorite, behind charlie and the chocolate factory; the least of the bunch was laura ingalls wilder's little house in the big woods, which to this day i have never finished.) i loved it, and immediately had mom drive me to the library so i could pick up the rest of the series. i got bogged down in the first fifty pages of the voyage of the dawn treader (which was, back then, the third book in the series). i tried, off and on, to finish the series over the years, but always got stuck in the same place. i finally finished dawn treader in march of this year. and thus here we are at the last battle, which i have finally managed to read over thirty-five years after it hit the to-read list. even for me, that's a record.

we are sometime long in the future after the events of the silver chair. narnia has known peace for generations, but along with that complacency has been aslan's absence; no one has actually ever seen him. thus it is that when a wily talking ape named shift and his compatriot, a donkey named puzzle, stumble upon the skin of a lion, shift comes up with a grand idea: he'll dress puzzle up in the lion's skin and use him as a mouthpiece to control all narnia. needless to say, word of the horrors being committed ni aslan's name soon reaches the ears of tirian, the current king of narnia, and he remembers the legends of other-worldly visitors who come to help narnia in times of crisis. soon enough, eustace and jill appear, and the battle is joined. problem is, it's not just puzzle and shift any more...

if you'll remember, the fifth book in the series, taken in the order in which lewis wrote them, was the magician's nephew. that was the book (now considered the first in the series) where lewis finally fobbed off with the whole medium-is-the-message bit and went straight to writing unsubtle christian allegory. it's also the weskest book in the series. he got back on track in the silver chair, but the last battle, as has been pointed out at least three dozen times over the years, is the revelation to the genesis of the magician's nephew. it's almost as if lewis didn't care any more and was simply trying to provide an end to the series. (frankly, if i'd replaced the pevensies with eustace scrubb, i'd have gotten sick of the series as well.) that said, it's still leagues better than the magician's nephew, for there is a story to it. well, the first three-quarters of it, anyway, after which it all becomes some vague religious nonsense that didn't satisfy much of anyone (even the zealots seem to think this ending is a touch downbeat).

upon reflection, i kind of wish i'd stayed in the same state i was when i was five, when i'd read the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe and prince caspian and still thought lewis was the bees' knees. as usual, when one puts away childish things, one finds that the alternative is drearier than one could have ever imagined. ***","i was let down by the ending too, but not for the same reason most seem to have been...",1291161600,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,Robert Beveridge

the thing about csl's writing is - it's funny! in my opinion his observations of human nature are gentle, humorous, and not preachy, although he is a christian.

the reason why this edition gets a ""negative star"" rating is because there are at least two changes in this new edition. why would you change an author's published words?  i guess to correspond with the movies, even though i seriously doubt that the thousands of kids who read these books in the original form were traumatized.",if i could give this negative stars....,1290384000,A1U4TFSQ0CLQEY,Kate Maldonado

  your pre-teen children after reading these books, will probably dig these books as much as you, easy to read yet have some words and phrases used in old english thus teaching the reader how it was, back in those days. i added an english accent when each character spoke, i could smell the forest and see in my minds eye, each scene. i had lots of fun reading these books and hated it when the book was coming to the end. i never enjoyed reading so much as i did then. read these stories and compare to the movies. so you can say that is not the way c. s. lewis wrote it, the movies were nice but lacked much compared to the books.
  i really will never forget nor stop recommending to all who would listen, treat yourself to an adventure and fantasy so enjoyable. it will stay in your heart and mind no matter how old you get, it may even affect the way you see things. the story has a message we all could stand to listen to.

6634,3,"c. s. lewis, the voyage of the dawn treader (harpercollins, 1952)

i first tried to read the narnia books back when i was a little squid, maybe six or seven years old. i had gotten the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe as a part of a six-book set and devoured it (it was second of the six in my affections only to charlie and the chocolate factory). back then, the books were still in ""classic"" order, so the second of the lot was prince caspian, and i ate that one up, too. then came the voyage of the dawn treader. i can't remember how far i made it through, but this was the book that caused me to give up on the series for thirty-odd years. in re-reading them now, i must say i approached this one with some trepidation, wondering what it was that had caused me to reject it so and whether it would have the same effect on me now. well, i've finished it, finally, all those years after i started it. reading it now, i'm certain what caused me to drop it in the first place was eustace, as unlikable a little sod as one is likely to find in a children's book. i know this because i know i didn't get far enough to expose the book's other weaknesses.

the book takes place a year after the events of prince caspian (in our world, anyway). peter and susan are grown up now and off in america on vacation, while lucy and edmund have gone to stay with annoying relatives. said annoying relatives have an even more annoying son, eustace, who enjoys lording it over edmund and lucy as often as possible. until, that is, they all get sucked into narnia. three years have passed there, and caspian has brought peace to the land, so he is off on a quest he promised to undertake long ago: the discovery of the disposition of seven knights his uncle had sent east to explore beyond narnia's borders. edmund, lucy, and eustace are along for the ride whether they like it or not, for caspian picked them up in the middle of the ocean almost a month into his voyage.

from here, the book turns episodic, and at times pedantic. it's the shallowest of the books i've read so far, because the moral likes to take hold and shake the story until only its skeleton remains on more than one occasion. when it doesn't, lewis' writing is up to its usual standards, but things grind to a halt often enough to jar. the episodes here are not seamless, either, which is unfortunate. episode, moral, episode, moral, with very little (if anything) tying them together. it gets kind of tiresome after a while.

still, if you're reading the series, you don't want to leave out a book that's right in the middle, and when it's good, it's as good as the rest of the books. if only that were the case for its entire length. ** ",weakest of the series.,1268697600,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,Robert Beveridge

6638,2,"i enjoy most of the narnia series, but this one leaves me cold.  the impression i get is that lewis wanted to repeat the success of lion/witch, but hadn't figured out how to scale up the story yet.  the problems?

(1) lion/witch had a tyrant, so this book has a tyrant, too.  so there's another civil war.  repetition, as i said.

(2) the rebels summon the kids from lion/witch to help, but why?  the kids have no special abilities, like the hobbits.  they don't bring twentieth-century technology with them.  they're good at horseback riding and archery, but a typical narnia soldier can do that as well.  basically they are there for propaganda purposes, to awe the narnians, but that's not heroic, and so lewis never admits that.  instead they have to fight in battles and risk getting killed.

(3) to keep the kids from reaching the rebels and finishing the story, lewis has aslan appear and play hide-and-seek.  supposedly it's to test their faith, but why would aslan think it needs testing at this point, particularly when lives are at stake elsewhere?

(4) eventually they reach the rebels and we get another war.  but this time there's no heroic scene comparable to aslan's self-sacrifice in lion/witch, so it's a second-rate repetition.

(5) most of the narnia stories have a moral, but i don't see one here.  that fighting is good?

most of the good stuff is in the last chapter when aslan is trying to arrange peace.  after revealing that caspian had evil ancestors, he tells the boy that he is only responsible for his own acts. he lectures a wounded rebel on accepting adversity, then gives up and heals him anyway.  he praises a man on the losing side for his bravery and advises the other rebels to follow him as they go into exile.  and there's the poignant revelation when peter and susan learn that they can never come back.  but the rest of the novel is pretty much a loss.",deja vu all over again,1267660800,A2ELZ5B0TVZDZQ,Charlesbalpha
6643,1,"you may not have minded this as a kid, but coming back to it as an adult, it's painfully obvious that ""the magician's nephew"" is the point at which the narnia series jumped the shark.  the white witch comes back to turn-of-the-century london and does nothing more than commandeer a carriage?  come on.

6646,5,"the last battle is the final volume of the seven books of the chronicles of narnia. it tells the tale of a self-centered and old, but clever ape that was very evil and a donkey that was profoundly stupid and did everything the ape told him to do
one day the ape found a lion skin, sewed it up and dressed the donkey in the skin, so that he looked like aslan, the noble lion, the founder and protector, the god-figure of narnia. the ape gathered the narnian beings, animals who talk, as well as calormene, dark skinned beings from another land. he enslaved the narnians to the calormene and forced the narnians to cut down the holy trees of narnia and perform menial tasks for him, such as bringing him nuts and bananas. he claimed that he was the spokes-being of aslan, who was the donkey in disguise, and insisted that he was more than an ape, that he was a human.
(c. s. lewis was probably having some fun here. the calormene probably represented colored-men, as they were called in his day, blacks, who were the masters and not the slaves.)
the king of narnia, a lad between twenty and twenty five years old, heard about the cutting of the trees and rushed with his friend, a unicorn, to stop the outrage. he did not believe that aslan could have ordered such an unholy deed. the two chance upon two calormenes beating a narnian and kill the calormenes (reminiscent of the act of the biblical moses in egypt). rethinking that perhaps aslan did order the tree cuttings, they surrender to the ape, who immediately ties the king to a tree and plans to kill him.
many adventures follow. how the king prays for the interventions of the humans from the other world, the sudden vision of the king before the previous seven visitors to narnia, and the appearance of eustace and jill in narnia. there are also three adventures of the saving of the king, the unicorn and the dwarfs.
when all are freed, more boisterous adventures follow: the appearance of the god of the calormenes, a hideous looking being; the revolt against the ape by other evil beings; the appearance of a large calormenesian army that takes over narnia and kills many of the king's friends, including the leaders of his army.
readers will discover if aslan appears and if he saves the narnians, or if this is the end of the narnian kingdom, and why this is the last battle. will eustace and jill be able to return to england? was alan's prediction true, that when they come they will be unable to return?
the final question is, ""will the readers miss the adventures of narnia?"" the answer is an emphatic, ""yes.""","unfortunately, the last delightful tale of narnia",1264550400,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,Israel Drazin
6656,1,"my parents got me a box set of lion witch & wardrobe books as a child. i read through the first one and found it nominally interesting, but not something that i would pick out on my own (i already knew the story from animated versions). i think i may have read half of the second one eventually. i was a heavy reader and followed lots of series type books, but in this case the plot didn't really flow for me. i think i may have heard something about a biblical connexion, but didn't think on that that much. it was only since a few years ago that i looked back at the books and saw how glaring the connexions were, and how the awkwardness with which a story was crafted to match biblical myth was the very thing that made it uninteresting to me.",not that great outside of biblical allegory.,1262476800,A1CYH2XIC6TJUY,Thomas
6659,5,"in this fourth book of the chronicles of narnia, things are not going well.  the king and his wife have both died, and their heir, prince caspian, is being raised by his uncle, miraz.  miraz takes the throne and declares himself king.  caspian escapes and finds his way to narnia.

miraz never believed in any of the old tales about narnia, talking animals, dwarves or even aslan.  caspian does, and is delighted to encounter all of these characters when he arrives in narnia.  the dwarves and animals all pledge their loyalty to caspian, but miraz is determined to put an end to him once and for all.  he brings an army and the battle for control of the kingdom begins.

outnumbered, things are not going well for caspian and his forces.  fearing defeat, he blows the magic horn left behind by susan when she, peter, edmund and lucy reigned the land.  although it was a thousand years ago, the tales of their heroics and kind governance remain part of the fabric of narnia.  the horn is supposed to bring the four to the aid of whomever blows it.  desparate, caspian does just that.

back in england, the four children are in a train station, ready to journey back to their respective schools after holiday.  to them, only a year has passed since their time in narnia.  but when the horn sounds, they are transported back, only to find that little remained that they recognized.  they met up with a dwarf from the caspian army, and he took them to meet caspian.  there, they fight at his side with the help of aslan who awakens the old magic of the land and mariz and his army are defeated.  caspian will be king caspian and rule narnia as it's rightful ruler.

6670,3,"though it was written after the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, the magician's nephew comes first in the continuity of the chronicles of narnia. in fact, towards the end of the book, the reader is a witness to aslan's creation of narnia, much like god creating the heavens and the earth. but what this first book is mainly about is the adventures of a young country boy named digory, who is still adjusting to life in london, and his neighbor, polly plummer. digory has moved to london with his dying mother to stay with his disciplinarian aunt letty and his oddly eccentric uncle andrew. you can see why they're both unmarried. letty seems to have a rule for everything and doesn't let anybody have any fun. his uncle seems a bit crazy. the trouble begins when digory and polly accidentally enter his uncle's study and find out that he's somewhat of an amateur sorcerer. there, they get involved in andrew's magical experiments, namely, magic rings that can take you through time and space to other worlds. his uncle has two different colors of rings. in theory, one color takes you to another world, while the other brings you back to this one. but he's never tried it with a human. he did send a guinea pig, literally, but it never came back. before he gives the children this information, andrew tricks polly into touching one of the rings and she instantly disappears! now it's up to digory to bring her back. unfortunately, not all of the worlds the children travel to are free of evil.

while i have always been aware of the narnia books and even remember watching an old cartoon version of the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe back in the 1980s, i didn't know the specifics of the story until watching the disney movies in recent years. when you compare the two narnia movies with his friend tolkien's lord of the rings cycle as envisioned by peter jackson, the narnia films were inferior. while i know the ring books were actually written as one long book until his publisher made him break it up, each section stands well enough on its own. the magician's nephew, on the other hand, is a book that can only be seen as an installment, and serves as little else except a prologue for fans of the series. while it's cool to know how narnia came into existence and to find out exactly where some of the characters and settings have their origin, the novel itself is not that great. cs lewis can write very well when he tries, especially in the scenes of hidden menace or the cold wonder when the kids are between worlds or encountering an evil queen. but at other times, this book seems more like it was written in the 1800s rather than in 1955. perhaps this was the idea as pauline baynes supplies illustrations very reminiscent of those in a charles dickens novel. i also think you can enjoy this series a lot more if you are ignorant of the christian symbolism. when is a lion just a lion? it was worth reading but falls way short of being a classic. but this is so often the case when you read a book that cannot be accurately seen except as part of a larger whole.",let go evil queen!,1250985600,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,Sesho
6674,2,"i suppose i was quite sad with the end of this book. it didn't really seem to have much purpose other than to end everthing in a most depressing way. i happen to be an atheist, but i don't mind reading literature like this if its done well, but this is not. the book just seemed kind of empty. really nothing like the silver chair, which i thought was a lot of fun to read or even voyage of the dawn treader, which had a very allegorical ending, but i thought it was done quite well.

6740,3,"c. s. lewis, the magician's nephew (harper collins, 1955)

back when i was a kid, i read what were then considered the first two and a half books of the chronicles of narnia; i never did make it through the voyage of the dawn treader. now, with the travesty that was the movie version of the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe hanging in my memory, i felt the need to go back and revisit these, first to see if i could finally finish dawn treader, and second to see if the books were as good as i remembered. now i find they've also altered the order of them, for chronological order of the story rather than the release dates. and thus i started with the magician's nephew, which back in the day was the fifth book in the series.

this one tells the story of the creation of narnia. there's an adventure bit thrown in for good measure, but it's really a creation myth. and i have to say i wasn't terribly fond of it, and i can't imagine i'd have liked it at all if it had been presented to me as the beginning of the series when i was growing up. there's just so much more going on in the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe (as i recall it, anyway). still, it's a quick read, if one where lewis was obviously writing to message rather than simply telling a story. but i certainly wouldn't recommend reading them in the ""present"" order; go back to the original, so you can be enchanted by the first books before getting to this. ***",not one of the series' better efforts.,1219104000,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,Robert Beveridge

in the lion, the witch and the wardrobe (the second narnia book) the children enter into narnia, emboundened with ice, narnia is a hard and cold place to live, through the devices of the witch. in the vendidad of the zend avesta (zoroastrian scripture) yima is warned by ahura mazda, the one most high and only true god warns him of an upcoming catastrophe: ""o fair yima, son of viva..hat! upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall bring the fierce, deadly frost; upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall make snow-flakes fall thick, even an ardvi deep on the highest tops of mountains."" it is in winter that snow-flakes fall, and only from a grey sky. but lets pray god almighty that we be spared from such a dreadful time ahead... and pray for peace, but without oppression, ""nevertheless father, not as i will, but as thou wilt"". we should do well to remember jesus's prayer in the garden of gethsemane before his crucifixion. shortly afterward he was betrayed by a kiss.

6746,3,"i'm always torn on what rating to give the narnia books.  i think if you take the series as a whole, it is - in a way - better than the individual books.
i did enjoy ""the last battle"" quite a lot!  and, unfortunately, took longer to read it than i would have liked (which probably didn't help the flow of it).  but, for the most part the good and the critiques are the same as always.
the world of narnia is beautiful!  aslan is always magnificent!  what we learn of the characters is enjoyable, and often fun, and i end up feeling like they have become friends.  the premises are always intriguing and filled with ""right and wrong.""  but, because all of this is so good, i'm left wanting more; more character development, more on the world, and the plot delved into further.
the ending went on - just a tad - long, for the individual book, however if you consider it the ending for the entire series, i think it's probably pretty accurate.
if you have liked the other books in the series, then i'm sure you'll want to eventually read this one!  it is quite an interesting concept/plot, and the story makes some interesting points.
and, of course, the world of narnia is always worth visiting!",narnia is always worth visiting!,1216684800,A329XLI71Q8HI6,A. Williams

6756,3,"as a child, i was enchanted by the worlds in the magician's nephew - the descriptions of charn, the creation of narnia, and the woods between the worlds - but i found myself cringing at the decidedly unsubtle allegory when i reread the book recently.

there is no avoiding the fact that this book is about good versus evil, nor that it is attempting to retell one of the creation stories from genesis with the creation of narnia. everyone seems rather wooden and pushed into the rolls lewis wants them to take and there is no real suspense or wonder. the good end happily and the bad do not, except for jadis who must play the roll of eden's serpent.

furthermore, i was rather appalled at the treatment of polly, the female ketterleys, and nellie/queen helen. i wish that i could better explain what i find so unsettling about them, but i can only point vaguely at their uselessness. i really didn't get a positive, empathetic feeling towards any of the women in the story, except for mrs kirke - and i suspect she only slides by because she's digory's mother and she's ill.

so, that's that. it's an interesting little book, but steeped in 1950s children's book conventions, and it could use a good deal of updating to match it with modern sensibilities and a more dynamic writer.

oh, and: i'm told in the opening pages that lewis intended it to be read first among the chronicles of narnia, but i must disagree with this. to have such a blatantly allegorical story first in the set is to lose much of the wonder of discovering narnia through the wardrobe with the pevensie children. besides which, much of the suspense and wonder in the second book are dashed away with all the background information that the magician's nephew provides.",not as enjoyable to re-read as an adult,1215043200,A1M0PDGWB6QHAQ,Keri

6762,4,"imagine if you once saved a magical other world... only to return later and find that centuries had passed, and everything had changed.

well, since the movie adaptation of ""prince caspian"" is about to come out, it seems appropriate to revisit c.s. lewis's classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic ""the lion, the witch and the wardrobe."" while it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.

when his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young prince caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle miraz -- and in the hands of narnia's secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. soon caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary queen susan -- and subsequently pulls the pevensies back into narnia.

but while only a year has passed on earth, centuries have passed in narnia, and the kids find that it's no longer the place they left -- they and aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. and as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help caspian, lucy keeps glimpsing aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...

the chronicles of narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. just take a look at successful, unique authors like diana wynne jones and garth nix to get an example of how lewis' stories have influenced the entire genre.

if you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of ""prince caspian,"" especially the second half. while lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic christian beliefs are very obvious. reportedly even tolkien, one of lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.

but if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a lovely little read. lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional british storytelling. but this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than ""the lion, the witch and the wardrobe,"" with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. the scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.

but lewis' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where aslan wanders around fixing life for narnian subjects. fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?

peter seems a bit more jaded than before and edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don't get enough to do this time around. but caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical trumpkin, who doesn't believe in lions.

despite a few rough spots, ""prince caspian"" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the chronicles of narnia. definitely give it a read before you see the movie.",back to narnia,1213142400,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,E. A. Solinas
6763,3,"as always, i somehow manage to get wrapped up in the narnia stories.  i don't know how or why, but i'm always curious as to what the next chapter will be.
this felt to me more like a collection of short stories than anything else.  each few chapters starts a new adventure, and there are very, very few plots lines that hold over.  and the few that do have little weight to the current ""adventure.""
nonetheless, the adventures that are embarked on are beautiful and intriguing, and the various islands are described with incredible detail and each one is unique from the other.
again, i felt (as i do with the other narnia books i've read) that there is so much more that could be expanded on, that the worlds and the characters have so much more to offer than what is told.  but, in a way i suppose that is a compliment as well, because i'd want to know more.
and, as always, certain characters (most characters) are very delightful, each with his or her own personalities.  and, of course, there is always something most beautiful and touching about aslan.",delightful mini adventures!,1213056000,A329XLI71Q8HI6,A. Williams
6766,3,"it's funny, how you come at these books as an adult and take something completely different away from them than you would as a child. i read these books about 20 years ago when my uncle gave me a complete set for my birthday. as a child, i think i read them simply as a fantasy/adventure story. as an adult, i can see the subtle religious references sprinkled throughout, and while some may see this as a hindrance to the story, at least through the first 2 books (i go by the original published order, not the new chronological order), i can look beyond that to the story underneath.

however, in the case of prince caspian, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of story. it seems to me that the book can be broken up into two sections: the first being the dwarf relating caspian's understanding of his role of narnia's future leader (the entire importance of this seems to be related to him over the course of one evening while star-gazing) and the second being peter, edmund, susan and lucy's trek through the jungle to get to caspian. the ending seemed too contrived for my liking and far too rushed. it was all build up and no follow through as far as i'm concerned.

looking at the story differently, it is a story about faith; about how faith can be hard to see sometimes, but it's always there and as long as you believe in that faith, it will lead you where you need it to. overall a good moral to the story, if a little didactic in the telling.",not the same when read as an adult,1212537600,A12HI5D3C2EGWJ,David Edmonds
6770,3,"just to be clear, the narnia series is one of the best children's book series ever written.  however, i found prince caspian to be much less compelling of a story than lion, the witch, and the wardrobe.  the book was good and i give it 3.5 stars, but it is not great.  the christian allegory is still there, but it is much less obvious.  nevertheless, this is still a good book and children will really enjoy it.",not as good as the rest of the series,1212019200,A9NFFAZF3LIB2,ironman96
6772,4,"to say this is the worst of the series is rather to say how great the series is.  this book is highly recommended, but the other six even more so.  prince caspian is simply less engrossing as story.  it is a book about bringing justice to the disenfranchised.  it is perhaps the most character-driven of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/narnia/dp/0066238501/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">narnia</a>&nbsp;books, which is probably why it would be difficult to make into a movie.  and the primary character is of course aslan.

the book focuses on aslan throughout, whether or not he is there.  indeed, the overarching theme is trusting in aslan, whether or not you see him.  pervading all the scene is aslan- discussions about him, discussions about how he doesn't exist, and a presence that can't be seen but some know is there.  character develops in response to the dilemma of the unseen aslan.

aslan isn't the only character though.  we are entertained by beautiful descriptions, like a bear who must put his foot into his mouth (suck his paws), or a giant who is always putting his foot into his mouth (metaphorically).  indeed, battle plans are drawn up precisely because of the characters of the different participants.  and we are introduced to perhaps the finest character of the narnia series- reepicheep, the valiant mouse.

but while character-driven, lewis seems to have taken a step back from writing good character in this novel.  there are good insights into the nature of belief, but the characters don't quite ring true.  and while it makes sense that aslan would save the day, as after all, the novel is about him, we don't get enough of a connection between the presence of the pevensies and the salvation of narnia at the end of that day.

thus there are two excellent reasons to read this book.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dawn-treader/dp/0060764945/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">dawn treader</a>&nbsp;doesn't make sense without it.  and for the lessons on faith that are gently told through story, as only a story can.",it's about aslan,1211760000,A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,Jedidiah Abdul Muhib Carosaari

6780,5,"sadly, the ""chronicles of narnia"" boxed set that i treasured as a child is out of print, so i decided to replace it with this collectible edition that contains all seven books in the series. i can't find any fault with the books themselves: these stories about four children who travel repeatedly to the world of narnia are treasured classics. in this edition, the books are presented in the order that author c.s. lewis preferred, which sucks. the correct order that i recommend is: 1.) ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe,"" 2.) ""prince caspian"", 3.) ""the voyage of the dawn treader,"" 4.) ""the silver chair,"" 5.) ""the horse and his boy,"" 6.) ""the magician's nephew,"" and 7.) ""the last battle."" if you are new to narnia, i highly suggest that you read the books in the order i listed here. if you read the books in the sequence they are arranged in the book, you will be very disappointed because everything will happen out of order. also, i was a little disappointed with the quality of the book itself...the binding cracked almost as soon as i opened the book. still, for $14.95, this edition is a steal, and the narnia books are just as enjoyable to me now as they were when i was a young girl.","an amazing collection of stories, but the book itself leaves a bit to be desired",1210118400,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,Amazon Customer
6784,2,"the other books were so gentle.  an adventure in narnia is like an adventure in one's backyard  -  kids just like us (or just like we once were) discover in their coat closet or attic or schoolyard a wonderful fantasyland next door.  they explore it under the guardianship of kindly fantastic creatures and, though there is real and potent evil, the battles are no more violent than a good dodgeball game.  lewis's habit as narrator of stopping and starting the story to explain unfamiliar concepts to his young readers or share memories from his own boyhood like a devoted grandparent only enhances the stories' warm intimacy and fairy-tale feel.

nothing of this narnia exists in the last battle.  we are here to see things die.  valiant kings and unicorns.  entire families, both parents and children.  horses by the herd.  *dogs*  -  lots of them.  (the animal deaths are milked for maximum effect; the dogs are heartbreakingly happy and slobbering, ""as doggy as they can be"", in their willingness to go to their deaths at calormene spears, and the horses are filled with arrows by jeering crowds after a dramatic helm's deep-ish arrival.)  i don't exactly recall how i reacted when i first read the last battle at ten years old, but i do remember that i wasn't that impressed with the overall proceedings.  revisiting them at twenty-nine, however, they're a knife in the heart.  every genesis means an eventual apocalypse, i suppose, but the book revels in nasty business in a manner quite contrary to the christianity of the previous volumes.  they painted its god and his son as a terrible force, yes, but also a loving and accessable one (""'course he isn't safe.  but he's good"") and trusted that children would be moved to goodness through the wonder of creation and the genuine consequences of evil behavior rather than through fear and gratuitous pathos and death.  the last battle compares poorly with the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, which featured true danger and death but did not compromise.

strange for me, then, to see others charge the book with being too ""syrupy-sweet"" and happy.  ""happy""?  this book made you *happy*?  well, yes, i suppose the denouement, with everyone  -  everyone, with one infamous omission  -  reunited in a narnian heaven is overwhelmingly happy in a two-dimensional sense; it reminds me of the artwork in awake! where, as humorist lore sjoberg put it, ""kids get to play with baby pandas for all eternity"".  there's no resonance, though, as everything, and everyone, is so two-dimensional.  the pevensies react without shock or sadness that their entire family has been killed in a railway accident and seem without regret that their paradise lacks their sister.  the denouement does little to dispel the long night before.  (the climax of the silver chair, with one beloved character rejoining his childhood friends and getting a five-minute romp in the ""real"" world he's always wanted to see, contains more genuine joy than everything in this ending.)

even if i look at the book with a proper critical eye, removed and analytical, it's lacking.  narnia's king tirian and his companion, jewel the unicorn, are sympathetic, but they are skimpily drawn compared to caspian or the cabby or even rillian.  after six books of wonders, the only memorable sights here are those of blood-curdling apocalypse.  (the image of narnia's human stars screaming home, their flaming silver hair streaking behind them, burns bright, but for a depiction of a world comsumed by greed and hatred, i will take the still, ruby-lit ruin of charn from the magician's nephew.)  narnia's downfall is implausibly, artificially swift; an ape slaps an old lion skin on a donkey, and the next day, calormen's sold cair paravel for paving stones.  had narnia's hold on independence and moral rectitude been this tenuous, it would have fallen long ago; it's implausible for both our heroes and narnia at large to be so submissive and inert in the face of evil.  the story is on rails to its ultimate destination; its only concern is to get everyone to martyrdom as quickly as possible.

the racism.  well, what is there to say that others haven't, really.  click the 2-star reviews and look for the one by joe w, who will tell you what it was like to read this material being eight years old and black.  the text explicitly points out how human narnians are all ""fair"" and contains a chanted slur that should not appear in any children's book.  likewise, tons of ink have been expended on the problem of susan; i'll just note that, while apologists claim it's the supposed single-mindedness of her obsession with ""stockings and invitations"" instead of its focus that gets her excommunicated, lewis does reliably identify ""feminine"" charm and frippery with his ""fallen"" females (the witches, lasraleen, susan).  sit down and have a good talk with your kids before they read this last chronicle.

as has been noted, no reader would plow through six volumes and skip the grand finale, but i dunno.  everything that lewis tries here  -  the end of a once-great world through human frailty; a radiant vision of heaven; a biblical allegory with a towering satan figure (who, unlike tash, isn't drawn directly from jack chick) and a terrible yet great son of god  -  he's accomplished before, far better, elsewhere in the series.  i would've been happier leaving narnia at the magician's nephew or the silver chair.","with a whimper.  oh, i'm sorry; that was from me.",1208649600,A1THEQV9LKFN35,racapowski
6789,3,"sixth book printed, first book chronologically.

i began re-reading the narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels.  mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when i was young, and i was interested to see how they held up as adults.  i found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.

""the magician's nephew"" is more clearly a children's tail than any of the other stories.  in terms of construction is it relatively formulaic compared to the other novels, beginning with the children discovering strange rings which transport them to narnia in its period of creation.

this is where the book differs from the others in the sequence.  we get to see narnia created from almost nothing, the birth or ""arrival"" of the godly aslan, and the seeds of ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"" in particular.  the christian metaphors are laid on a little thickly here, but a child wouldn't notice them, nor would the allusions to christ or adam and eve spoil their enjoyment.  as an adult i found the story very readable, but sadly insubstantial compared to ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe"" or ""prince caspian"".

6808,1,"years after writing this review, i stumbled on it because i am looking to buy the series for yet another niece. i am suprised at the animosity i see in responses to my review, but i think i understand its source. a number of people will immediately dis you if you rate something special to them as a ""1"". (other people will of course dis it as a form of religious activism.) indeed there is no question that the stories rate a ""5"", but in my opinion this all-in-one published format of the book is not as enjoyable as boxed versions where every book is unique in itself. this is especially true for young readers, just imagine them holding each book in their little hands and you'll get the idea. also, it feels bulky and the pages just don't turn as well. i like books - physical books - and this all-in-one is just not as enjoyable.
so, i still think this all-in-one format deserves a ""1"" in enjoyability, although i am sure it is a very efficient reference to the original stories if that's your thing. i am in fact going to buy the ""the chronicles of narnia box set: full-color collector's edition [paperback]"" that is now available with pauline baynes' colorized drawings (i am not a purist) and i am very much hoping to give that published version a ""5""!

original review:
if you want to buy all the narnia books at once, at the moment you generally face buying either the all-in-one book with the lion on the cover or the seven separate books in one ""boxed set"". the problem with both offerings is that that they are numbered ""wrong"" (chronologically by narnia time, which is not the published order and spoils the wonder of the series). however, at least if you buy the separate books in the boxed set, you can rearrange and read them in the published order, recommended by everyone but academics (and the order which the author never changed in his lifetime, despite the publisher's claim that he ""preferred"" them in narnia chronology).

another reason to buy the boxed set is that you do get the great pleasure of holding each individual book in your hand as you read them. i've done so as a young child, as a college student, and now in my middle age, and each time c.s. lewis' wonderful tales transport me out of this world. it's a personal thing, but i also appreciate the original pauline baynes drawings, which the harpercollins boxed set does have. just be sure to do a favor for the next reader or the person you're giving this as a gift to - mark out the harpercollins numbering on the cover.

by the way, if you are ""not religious"" like me, you will find the pedantic discussion of how the books correlate to religion or the christian bible to be obnoxious. like other great artists, c.s. lewis transcended religion and wrote 7 incredible books drawing from amongst the archetypes of his own culture and mythology. do yourself a favor, turn off the incessant chatter, and just enjoy the books.",don't buy all-in-one paperback,1200182400,A3BQXW6A42RSUU,D.

6813,4,"prince caspian, the 4th book in c.s. lewis' the chronicles of narnia series and the 2nd one published, continues the adventures of the pevensie children in narnia. the story opens with peter, edmund, susan, and lucy waiting at the train station to return to boarding school for the year where they are yanked by magic onto the shores of a strange forested island.

time, one must remember, does not move the same way in narnia as it does in the real world; the pevensies could spend 100 years in narnia and return to reality to find that no time at all has passed. it turns out that hundreds of narnian years have passed during the year that the children have been away and the narnian world has been thrown into chaos -- the animals no longer speak; a new line of kings govern the land with a harsh scepter; the oceans have risen and the landscapes changed; the people have forgotten the ways of the old line of kings; and the stories of the old narnia have been forbidden to be told. beyond that, it seems forever since the last time the great lion, king aslan, has been seen at all, and his existence has been dismissed by most as mere silly legend.

this installment of the series pales only slightly to the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe. the story of our four narnian protagonists shows us once again that their identities in aslan's kingdom have nothing to do with what they do and everything to do with who(se) they are. lucy is faced with the toughest decisions this time around, as she is asked to choose whether she will follow aslan even if the people closest to her consider her crazy for doing so. i am struck again by the ease of c.s. lewis' storytelling voice. while he may not deliver the most complex plots or character arcs, the tone and pacing of his language makes me wish i were a child again and could sit in front of the hearth and listen to his stories aloud.

6859,3,"most collections of ""the chronicles of narnia"" number ""the magician's nephew"" as the first novel in that series. lewis actually wrote this introductory novel sixth in the series of seven novels as a prequel explaining some of the things in narnia. he began to write ""the magician's nephew"" as the second book in the series, but dropped off and never finished it until he had written almost all of the other books.

reading the magician's nephew is a necessary thing for anyone who wants to learn about the magical land called narnia. it's basic and elemental. it's lewis's genesis, but just as people coming to the christian faith don't need to read genesis first to understand christianity you don't need to read the magician's nephew first. in fact, it may be even more satisfying to read it after ""the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe."" (i don't think it would be good, however, to hold off reading this book until 6th.)

in this novel, a young boy named digory and a young lady named polly take an especially exciting adventure into another world through the use of some very special rings. through the use of these rings, the two are able to visit magical lands that hold amazing parallels to the world that they left. throughout the course of the book, lewis takes us on an adventure through a sort of theological ""a christmas carol,"" where we can see worlds of the past, future, and present.

throughout the course of the book, lewis masterfully writes to the children of god who are young in age and at heart. the book is simple enough to be read out loud to a child who isn't old enough to read for him or herself, and it's entertaining and nuanced enough to make even the most sophisticated reader chuckle a little here and there.

6900,2,"i think that the real point is being missed by asking whether or not c.s. lewis was racist. the question is, what is the effect of the books on their target audience; namely children between eight and twelve years of age. what will the impact of reading about the calormene darkies on a child.

i read these books when i was eight. as was intended i identified with the boys fighting against evil and treachary in the service of narnia, etc, etc etc. then in the middle of ""the last battle"" i hit the word ""darkies"". and i knew that he was talking about me. there was a sense of betrayal and shame and disbelief. it was a kick in the stomach.

as a eight year old black boy, i had no greater world view, nor a concept of a person being the ""product of his times."" nor did i understand that he was probably (like it really matters) deriding arabs and not blacks.

its not a question of whether or not lewis was a racist. we and our children will read many books that have some sort of bias. there is no help for it. but this man and this body of work was presented to a child as an embodiment of the worth of our society. a body of work that apparently finds some children worthless. that may or not have been his intent, but such an ambiguous message should not be touted as being so unambiguously christian or so absolutely moral.

setting aside religious and racial issues, this is not a well written book.  its not horrible, but the narration wanders and unlike the earlier novels, there are no clear personalities between characters.  they tend to speak with one voice; that of the narrator.",not much to recommend it.,1156636800,A1BZ63LWNQMESA,Joe W
6909,3,"the magician's nephew is the first book, the prequel if you will, of the chronicles of narnia series. apparently it was really the 7th book written (or 8th, i'm too lazy to look it up) in the series, and there remains some contention whether the author wanted it printed as the first or last book. a friend told me about this debate, and at this point it's taken up far too much of the review than it's worth. the important point is that this book is a prequel.

in going with the general nature of prequel books, this is a boring ""pre""-cap of how things got to be the way they are in narnia, or how they were before the series started. if i had read this and knew nothing about the hype, i wouldn't bother with the rest. given the hype, and the fact i already own the series, i'll read the next book, upon which the movie is based.

the book fits the typical prequel mold, rambling and antiseptic, attempting to fit certain things where they might not necessarily belong. events might happen that make you scratch your head. the wardrobe, which obviously plays a role in the next book, comes to life in this first book, setting the stage for later things to come (i imagine).

anyway, it's a prequel to a very popular series. i'm not sure if this should be read first or last, but no matter when you read it, it's very short and basic. a neat little story setting things up for where they will eventually go.",the boring prequel,1152057600,A3M77GPST0EICR,Norm Zurawski

the book i have read was called the magician's nephew. the author was c.s. lewis. what this book was about a boy named digory and a girl named polly. polly and digory were walking home one day when they discovered digory's uncle's secret workshop. they found uncle andrew down there. hw was telling them about his new experiments. they thought he was crazy. when they were about to leave uncle andrew told polly to take a colored ring. she took one of them and she disappeared. uncle andrew told digory that the only way that he was going to get her back was to put on a ring and find her and bring her back. he took two rings, one for him to leave, and one for him to come back. what will happen to polly? what will digory do to his uncle when he comes back from his trip? these are some questions that you will only find the answers by reading the book.

 i thought this book was pretty interesting to read. there were some exiting parts, like when digory rang the bell with the hammer. i also thought there were some pretty boring parts, like in the begging because there was nothing happening. i was not able to feel like i was in the book because the characters did not seem realistic to me. i didn't see the characters as being very realistic because they had talking animals and giant people. i also didn't think it was realistic because the people acted like they had no feelings and they acted very immature. i thought this books ending was a little bit disappointing because there was no fighting and it didn't tell what happened fully after everyone left narnia. it did not say what happened to aslan or the king and queen. i think the author could have added a lot more stuff to the ending.

 c.s. lewis had a very immature voice through out the whole book. he mad you seem like he was talking to a 3 year old the whole time. i feel like that this book was not very age appropriate for me. i think the voice of this would be better for a 3 year old. i did not find any interesting vocabulary what-so-ever in this book. the author used vocabulary for 7 year olds and always explains stuff with very little detail. the ahtors writing style was perfect for a children's book, or a picture book. he did not have the right style for a teenage-leveled book. i thought the author used a pretty good amount of dialogue in his book. i think he could have added a little bit more but over all it was a decent amount. i also think he could have added more humor to his writing. the author used not much detail and he did not describe the setting very well. i thought the author used the same tone over and over again and it became very boring very fast. he always had a slow sort of childish tone through out the whole story. i think the author could have made the book more mature and he could have added more humor to it to really perk my interest in this book. i think he could have added more parts to it and he could have added more action to this book, to make it seem at least a little bit more interesting.

 i thought this book was an okay book. this book is pretty good to the other books i have read. i thought this book lacked many qualities that would have made this book really good, or at least an 8out of 10. i thought this book deserved a 6 out of 10 because its plot was okay but it was very childish. the characters did not seem real to me at all. also the dialogue in it was not very satisfying. i thought the author, c.s. lewis, could have added a lot more to the book's ending. it seemed like a whole chunk of the book's ending was missing. i think this book is okay for both boys and girls but i think you should be about 8years old to like this book. i would never recommend this book to any one over the age of 12.

i thought the magician's nephew was an okay book. it was not amazing, but it was not horrible. it did not have such a great ending and it was not very mature. i think this book is great for younger kids, but i would never let any one over the age of 12 read this. this book is in a long line of the narnia series. i thought the other books were much better then this one. the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe was a lot better then this book. i thought this book was lacking action and comedy. i think you would much rather like c.s. lewis's other books more then this. frankly i think this book is a waste of time. i believe you can read his other books without reading this one.",the magician's nephew,1148774400,A3TX6UWGAHJ2TR,Elizabeth R.

6926,1,"religious fanatics are usually at their worst when trying to convince others of their exalted status in the afterlife, and unfortunately lewis, who makes no bones about the christian message in his books, falls into this trap in this, the concluding volume to the narnia series. it's as though his urgent need to proclaim the word has blinded him to the fact that the story in the last battle has a confusing, paper-thin plot, relies on racist stereotypes, glorifies violence, and is full of plodding, frankly boring characters. the lion himself doesn't even show up until the very end, and for once i had to ask myself why: why doesn't he show guidance to the bedraggled king tirian and his befuddled troop of talking animals and children? because lewis wants to save him for the fireworks at the end--fireworks that prove to be mostly duds.

it's not that lewis isn't (or wasn't, rather) capable of writing inspired, mystical prose; he does this very well (despite a few hilarious anomalies) in the voyage of the dawn treader. but the concluding sequence that's supposed to parallel the book of revelation is but a pale reflection of the breathtaking conclusion to that epic sea voyage. (which is ironic, since lewis, ever the heavy-handed scholar, even slips in a plato reference while describing the ""old"" narnia as but a pale reflection of the so-called ecstatic ""real"" narnia that our blessed, now-dead children romp through at the end.)

the christian references land everywhere, like stink bombs. we have the false prophet (shift monkey), the unbelievers (dwarfs), the minions of satan (calormenes), and of course satan (tash). nowhere does the story explain who tash is, and his role in the scheme of things, why the calormenes are so mean, and particularly, why aslan decided to just chuck the whole narnia thing to a feast of giants and monster lizards at the end. none of it makes sense.

part of the problem, too, is that lewis can't seem to make up his mind whether he's writing a clever fairy tale or a religious tract. when the story swings into full metal apocalypse at the end, i can't imagine any children actually enjoying this thing.

oh, i suppose it makes sense if one is a white, born again christian anglophile who loves allegories and...oh, gee, i forgot, all of those have already left for new narnia.

one more thing, very curious. lewis may have had misgivings about his brutally racist depiction of the calormenes, because at the end he slips one of them into paradise. this soldier in tash's army is presumably let in because, while he never consciously embraced aslan, the good lion evidently decided he had a good heart and was pursuing the noble truth; he just hadn't put the right label  on it. which sort of goes against everything any evangelical christian has ever said. had lewis wove such interesting philosophical hairballs into the rest of his story, it would have made for more palatable moments, if not a workable plot.",lewis falls on his own sword,1145404800,AI5YLDZ9MUA9H,James Webster

from his writing style, you can tell c.s. lewis is from another era. compare the magician's nephew, to say the first page of a modern day fantasy bestseller such as the sword of shannara, by terry brooks, and this becomes apparent.

the magician's nephew is a book that is story driven, and the story takes place is various world that leave you wanting more detail instead of bogging itself down by placing 6 adjectives upon every tree, as is the case in much modern fantasy. 2 children, polly and digory take a journey that includes many memorable stops, and end upmeeting aslan and watching the birth of narnia.

at the very least, i would suggest that parents talk to their children about some of the more problematic parts of this book, particularly the ending, which some children might find disturbing, however rosy and feel-good the presentation may be.

apart from that, there is some good action and description, although the plot seemed much more disjointed than those of the other books to me.","some horrible messages, in my opinion, but may be blunted by parental guidance",1143936000,A22CN6T98WY8ZZ,L.S. Jaszczak

that's right - i feel i have brought this suffering on myself, for much to my surprise, i realized how frightfully simplistic and boring this work is!!  amazon says that this work should be read three times: in childhood, early adulthood, and late in life.  i seriously object to that.  while young children (nine and below) will adore these books, it is certainly not for anyone older.  the stories are painfully dull with the christian allegory so blindingly obvious that it is treacly and sanctimonious.  in our digital, media-saturated age, i wonder if any child above the age of 9 can enjoy, or be moved, by the book as lewis intended.  the stories are too simplistic with little character development - i.e., rather than the young heroes overcoming conflict via personal growth or understanding, aslan magically resolves everything for them as long as they believe in him.  yes, this is a christian allegory and so faith must no doubt play a central theme; however, the books seem to prescribe a children's formula calling for too much passivity mixed with blind faith.  perhaps children must be taught faith first, but as a parent, i don't feel comfortable with the treacly message given to my eight year-old.  certainly, older kids will not be won over by this story.

finally, i should say something about the britishisms in this book:  obviously this is a book written in the british english of an oxbridge don from the first half of the 20th century, and it shows.  there are a lot of britishisms that are hard to explain (some passages i didn't even understand!)... i was busy trying to ""americanize"" many passages as i was reading aloud, which really kept me on my toes.",a bit too outdated?,1143417600,A23NK6EGOX0LTM,Harold
6946,5,"the last battle is the seventh and final book in the chronicles of narnia.  the story begins when an ape named shift and his ""friend"" (though actually more of a slave) puzzle the donkey discover a lion's skin floating in a river.  shift decides to use the skin and dress puzzle up as aslan.  puzzle is against the idea, but shift convinces him that it is what aslan wants:  they wouldn't have found the skin if aslan hadn't wanted them to and he wanted them to do this to be his mouthpiece to the narnians.  of course, puzzle has no idea that shift has already made plans with the calormenes to slowly invade and take over narnia.

a grand scheme is concocted and slowly the animals, dwarves, and other free creatures of narnia give up their freedom and liberty and submit themselves into slavery under the calormenes.  king tirian learns of this news and though he is brave, he is also rash.  he and his friend jewel the unicorn attempt to confront shift and set things right. unfortunately, they end up causing trouble and killing some calormenes unprovoked.  instead of fleeing to gather their forces tirian and jewel turn themselves over for not only are they brave, but they are also honorable.

tirian is tied to a tree and in his distress he cries out to the children from another world that have helped narnia in times of great distress in the past.  eustace scrubb and jill pole are sent in answer to his cries.  they release tirian and together they free jewel the unicorn and puzzle the donkey.  it is this small band that leads the narnians against the calormenes and blasphemers in the last battle of narnia.

as the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is to the gospel story and the magician's nephew to genesis so is the last battle to revelation.  it is the story that tells how narnia ends.

out of the seven books about narnia, the last battle is my favorite.  many people seem to prefer either beginnings or the middle parts of a story and therefore find the last battle to be their least favorite book.  personally, i like endings.  i've read the book of revelation more than any other book in the bible.  return of the jedi is my favorite star wars film and indiana jones and the last crusade is my favorite film in the indy trilogy.  my favorite episodes of a television show tend to be the well written series finales. when i first start reading a book i'm tempted to jump to the last few pages first (though i rarely ever do) because if the story has a bad ending i know i won't like it.  granted, some of the issues raised in the last battle don't have the deep philosophical and spiritual overtones that most of the other stories in the series do.  nevertheless, those philosophical and spiritual overtones are there; they just aren't quite as overt.  whatever the case, the last battle is a book that all narnia fans have to read because it's the only way to know how the story will end.",all good things must come to an end,1142985600,A96K1ZGW56S2I,tvtv3

6997,3,"the chronicles of narnia were written for children.  perhaps, if i had read them when i was a child, i might have a different opinion of them.  but my taste for fantasy developed later, and so i read the chronicles as an adult.  lewis's intent was to write for children, and that is obvious.  that these stories have remained popular for 50 years is proof enough that they are good children's books.  but as an adult, i do not find them all that attractive; and even as children's literature, i believe these tales have their faults.

there are some faults inherent in the way children's books are written.  chapters and adventures are brief; lewis made them so intentionally.  in ""the voyage of the dawn treader"" it gets quite obvious that each short adventure was meant to be read separately, as when a child is first learning to read, or when a parent reads a story to a child before bedtime.  as an adult, i found that particular tale to be somewhat tedious -- a succession of short adventures, quite disconnected, raced through quickly unto a purpose i could not really discern.  nonetheless, this style was deliberate and is probably desirable when writing for young children.

there are at least two flaws in the book, however, that i think are weaknesses even in children's literature.  lewis has the annoying tendency to put asides in the text, when the narrator stops telling the story and makes comments to the imagined child audience.  this to me gave the impression that he was talking down to the audience, that is, to the reader; and i do not think that is desirable even in a children's book.

more seriously, there are times that the plot simply does not make sense.  the last of the tales, ""the last battle,"" makes little sense at all.  i am not sure why lewis depicted narnia's armageddon as a fight that had only a few dozen characters on either side.  what is worse is that the battle seems to have no purpose -- if all one has to do is walk through the door of the hut after aslan and enter the ""new heavens and new earth,"" then why fight the battle?  lewis's purposes for the battle seem to be that first, he had to have an armageddon at the end to complete his religious allegory, and second, because kids like battles.  the characters in the story do not know it is time for the end of their world, and so they fight to try to save it; but why would aslan allow them to do so?  the whole last tale left me with the feeling that ""the last battle"" was useless.

some reviewers found lewis's heavy-handed religious symbolism and allegory offensive; i believe it had to be made so.  lewis was writing a christian fantasy for children.  as such the symbolism had to be on an obvious level that children could grasp.  tolkien's ""lord of the rings"" is as full of christian symbolism as are the chronicles of narnia, but tolkien was writing his fantasy for adults, so the symbolism is better hidden -- so well that most readers probably never notice it.  if lewis had hidden his symbolism that well, it would have defeated his purpose of telling christian stories to children.

in sum, the chronicles of narnia were written for children.  as children's literature, they work pretty well.  at least they are better for children than the politically-correct tripe published today.  as an adult, i find them less attractive than a child might; but lewis wrote them for children, and that fact should never be forgotten.","remember, it's a children's book",1138320000,A173MRM1ZZXG9M,Dennis Drury
6998,3,"this story follows the time-honored tradition of sea journeys that started with homer's the odyssey and continues to this day with the star trek series: a crew of characters goes from island to island (planet to planet), encountering strange beings, weird portents, and various threats before moving on to the next obstacle. in this, lewis succeeds rather well. in particular, the chapters on the darkness, where you are swallowed by dark and your dreams (nightmares?) come true, the disturbing golden pond of death, and the land of the dragon, are captivating episodes. and close to the very end, in which the voyagers approach the end of the world (apocalypse, anyone?) and are bathed in a preternatural light, has its own driving beauty; i found myself captivated by the rhythm of the language and raced to the end.

these are the high points. unfortunately, lewis continues to subject his readers to the same smarmy attitude, elliptical comments, and heavy-handed christian symbolism that plagues his other stories. in particular, i found his continual poking at eustace, the obnoxious cousin of the pevensie's, objectionable. he exposes his conservative roots by criticizing him and his parents as pacifists and vegetarians! i almost put the book down at that point. hey, if i were eustace, i'd probably demand to see the british consul as well! when he gets turned into a dragon, i thought bravo! who wouldn't want to be a dragon? but no, he had to get aslan-ized, humbled, and returned to the flock. too bad.

then there's reepacheep. i found this overgrown mouse, who has to fight anything and anyone to uphold his sense of ""honor,"" to be tiresome indeed. why aslan let him into his magic realm at the end is beyond me.

the main character, of course, is lucy. despite his heavy-handedness, lewis is able to maintain lucy's charm. if there's one thing i do like about lewis, as opposed to tolkien's lord of the rings, is that he is able to get into the mind of a female child character.

then there's aslan (epigram: nasal). more so than the lion, the witch & the wardrobe or prince caspian, the big cat seems to conveniently be there for every close call, dipping into the story like a feline deux ex machina. the story doesn't start out that way--in fact, right after eustace got dragonized, i said to myself, ""hey, this is great! no aslan!"" of course, alsan then shows up immediately to rescue him. while young children may find this comforting, i find it a copout. and once reformed, eustace becomes a boring non-character.

oh, one more thing. i found it interesting that the place where ""dreams come true"" is in fact a kind of bermuda triangle, a black hole in the middle of the sea, and the only dreams are nightmares. this is a reversal of the usual meaning of the phrase, which normally carries a very positive connotation. was lewis himself haunted by nightmares? i've always found dreams fascinating, even the disturbing ones, and i was somewhat disappointed that the attitude that lewis promotes is that bad dreams are to be avoided, not dealt with.",these are the voyages of the starship dawntreader-a writer's review,1138147200,AI5YLDZ9MUA9H,James Webster

reading this book (written for children of all ages, including grown ones!) will do many good things for you.  the most important thing is that it will make you love god more, love his son jesus more, and understand the gospel better.  i first read the lion, the witch and the wardrobe when i was 29 years old and i openly wept over various parts of the book as well as rejoiced over the triumphant ending.

""the magician's nephew"" starts off this wonderful series.  if you've only seen the new movie, start with this one.  you'll learn who the professor is and what he has to do with narnia.  you'll get to see how narnia was created by aslan himself, and how the white witch came into the picture.  one of the coolest things was how the lamppost came to exist in narnia, and how the wardrobe of the second book came to be built, and contained enough magic to send four children between worlds.

i am a young adult fantasy author myself, and i think this is a fantastic book.  while written for children, it's an awesome experience for adults as well.  it's easy to see why lewis was one of the early masters of the fantasy genre.

i was read these books as a child and unfortunately for me, this was not a series i should have revisited. i severely disliked all 7 of these books. i found lewis' writing style to be downright annoying and, honestly, quite poor. the christian mythology that is supposed to be cleverly hidden in these stories, isn't really hidden or clever at all. i found it to be heavy-handed and cumbersome. i was also appauled by how this series ended. all of the children and their parents are killed in a horrible accident, but it's ok, because now they all get to live in narnia forever. what? this is supposed to be a children's story, and i find that disturbing.

i cannot honestly say i would recommend these books to anyone.","terrible, just terrible.",1136764800,AG2IEP1MJQHFS,Kelly Houser
7017,5,"the chronicles of narnia is a marvelous set of seven fairy tales about a world other than our own where a lion named aslan serves as the voice of wisdom, goodness and power. many believe them to be tied to c. s. lewis's christian beliefs, which they surely would be as one writes about what one knows and believes at some level, whether intentional or not. however, it seems to me that the stories in the chronicles are as much about basic truth, goodness and the concept that there is a power bigger than each of us, whatever our religion or lack thereof. as regards religious belief(s), all religions in which god is the center share similar `truths' and differ, primarily, in the interpretation of how these truths are to be viewed and how they are to be applied to living. well, enough of that.

the lion, the witch and the wardrobe was the first written and it introduces us to four children: lucy, edmund, susan and peter. the four siblings have a most extraordinary adventure when they travel to another world called narnia through a large wardrobe in a room in a large country estate outside london where they've been sent for safety during world war ii. they meet some powerful characters, a host of talking animals, and become instrumental in the overthrow of the wicked white witch who has caused a hundred years of winter in narnia (but no christmas). eventually the children return home. later they (or some of them, at least) return to narnia for further adventures in the stories of prince caspian, the voyage of the dawn treader, and the silver chair. other children experience narnia as well in the horse and his boy and the magician's nephew, until the enchanted land comes to an end in the last battle.

the essay at the end of the book about writing for children is enlightening. as lewis states, however, don't expect to learn how to write for children by reading the essay. he says he's not conceited enough to think he could do that. reading it will, however, give the reader better insight into lewis's philosophy of writing in general, but, most particularly, for the young.

there's ongoing controversy over the reading order of these remarkable stories which c.s. ""jack"" lewis began writing in 1949 and finished in 1956 (he died in 1963). my preference is to begin with the lion, the witch and the wardrobe (i find it interesting that hollywood started with this one and not the chronological first one, the magician's nephew. it gives me hope that they can do some things right). i, for one, would not want to know some things about narnia at the beginning of the series. it makes me wonder how future generations will think the six (so far) star wars sagas should be viewed. will there be controversy over whether or not the first in the series should be the prequel we have today in which we learn who, why and how darth vader became darth vader? i, again, would not want to know right away. having seen the first one in the 70s, i appreciate that my questions about dv fermented for a time, to be answered later; but, will future generations agree?

however you read the chronicles of narnia, just read them. it's a worthwhile expenditure of time and effort!

7019,3,"i recommend chronicles of narnia to any child or pre-adolescent with interest in fantasy books. the book is too simplistic to be recommended to anyone older, and too religiously allegorical for those who find religious allegory in a fictional work tacky and forced.

while frequently compared to lord of the rings, the narnia chronicles is hardly a match. comparing the two is largely impossible - their only similarities being the authors' mutual acquaintance, and the general genre of the works. whereas tolkien's books are painstakingly detailed, the average narnia book is brisk - both in its attention to detail and flow of time. while tolkien's works construct and reveal a near-impeccably built world - complete with fictitious histories, geography and languages, the world of narnia is largely thrown-together (consider ""the magician's nephew"" as one proof - it contains a large number of ideas that are never again elaborated upon). the creatures of middle earth draw from several different cultures and myths, while those of narnia are largely directly lifted from greek mythology.

for the inquisitive reader, the religious allegory of c.s. lewis is sometimes obvious (like adam/eve, aslan's ""crucifixion""), at times annoying, and at some points even bigoted. as an example, consider calormen - an obvious reference to an islamic nation. unlike narnia, calormen is full of the rich and deceitful who worship all the wrong things - gold, large palaces, their own leader... the devil... (yes, you read that correctly). as a christian, lewis obviously chose to ignore some of the more infamous moments in christianity (like the opulence of baroque period churches, the spanish inquisition, the crusades, etc...). lewis also takes numerous stabs at contemporary schools that no longer teach religion, but science and other ""less important"" things. to top everything off, the ending is mind-bogglingly and foolishly cruel, at least for a children's book.

contrary to what some readers have pointed out, this book reads on no more than 2 levels - it reads as a great series of children's books, or as veiled religious dogma that was the fifties' answer to today's intelligent design.","good children's book, and... that's pretty much it",1136505600,A3EQ61ES6HQ090,impitbosshereonlevel2

1.  cs lewis himself expressed a preference to have the books ordered by their chronological order, relative to their order within narnian time as this set does.

2.  if you don't like the order .... read them in any order you like.

next question?  ;)

that out of the way, this is the way you want to buy the chronicles in paperback form.  do not buy the single volume of all books in one cover, in the paper back form!  the binding will not stand up to repeated reads and children will find it overwhelming.  if you want the 1 volume set, and it's equally a fine book, then pay the extra and get the hard cover.

while not an allegory, in the strictist sense of the word, lewis' chronicles of narnia are certainly allegorical in nature and very representative and illustrative of christian theology.

that feature is greatly prized by parents who want to teach as well as entertain.

rest assured however, that the book and characters themselves are sufficient to entertain and still excellent even if the allegorical element is not what you are looking for.

there is never a dull moment because every landing is an adventure for the crew.  there is an island of invisible creatures, an island of slaves, an island of darkness, and much more.  my favorite scene is when on one island, lucy is sent to do a task, and she witnesses beautiful but tragic things that could only be seen once.  aslan, the mystical lion that watches over narnia, makes appearances, and he is especially close with dear little lucy.  also, i loved watching eustace emerge as a mature character in the end because in the beginning, he was absolutely dreadful.  caspian's nobleness is striking, but character-wise he does not change a lot.  the ending is, as one reader put it, allegorical, with light everywhere, and i found the scene to be very beautiful and breathtaking.  c.s. lewis' descriptions are always vivid, but the last scenes paint absolutely brilliant pictures.

7217,3,"""prince caspian"" is either the second or fourth book of cs lewis' classic narnia series, depending on whether one reads the books in published order or chronological order. the story picks up where ""the lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" leaves off, with peter, susan, edmund and lucy back in england after having spent many years in narnia as kings and queens. what follows is in many ways almost a straight rehash of ""wardrobe"" and is possibly the most forgettable of the narnia books. were it not for the introduction of caspian, one of the major characters in the series, it would almost certainly be the least memorable of the seven books.
the children find themselves pulled into a strange world, this time by a magical force rather than by wandering through a wardrobe. quickly (and predictably) enough the world is revealed to be narnia. why did they not know this right away? because the single year they spent in the real world was many hundreds of years in narnian time. narnia has aged while they have not.
the four children, who in narnia are revered as legendary kings and queens of old, find that they have been pulled into narnia to aid king caspian, a prince from a kingdom of rather oppressive humans who have taken over narnia and are attempting to squash all memory and knowledge of the land's talking animals and mythical creatures. naturally, this means those people have to be stopped.
if it sounds exciting, it's not. if it sounds boring, it is.
travelogues and adventures that are little more than episodic journeys can be great fun and often tap into the glory of exploring the forest as a child, but this journey simply has little or nothing to engage the reader or capture one's interest. the glimpses of how narnia has changed in the years since the four kids were there are interesting, but the interest is minimal at best. the travels just lack punch or adventure.
lewis takes a few ill-advised detours that seem only to pad the story while hammering home the idea that people who do not believe in the mystical creatures of narnia are inherently bad. the heavy-handed messaging in other narnia volumes generally feel like the moral messages of any other classic fairy tale, but here they somehow feel wrong.
all in all, ""prince caspian"" adds very little to the lore (and lure) of narnia despite being a part of the central plot, with core narnia characters throughout. its greatest contribution to the series is introducing the off-kilter time concept, an old clich&eacute; of alternate world stories, and bringing the character of caspian (as well as the delightful and brave mouse reepicheep) to the series. and that's about this book's whole worth. it introduces you to characters you will grow to like later and to concepts essential to the series.
take note, because ""prince caspian"" is part of the core narnia books (those involving the four original children and the characters linked directly to them) it's hard to recommend skipping this one - but it really fails to live up to the fantastic spectacle of the others. children may enjoy the return romp to narnia, but more likely even they will find that this one disappoints.",the least desirable entry,1082764800,A1PEKEZTSDJAVH,Eric San Juan
7222,4,"c.s. lewis's the magician's nephew is a fast paced fantasy that takes place in multiple worlds.  by magic, a young child, digory, is transported to a different universe.  he encounters many evils and must overcome great peril.  being courageous and fearless along the way, he meets new friends and animals to help him.  there are also elements that help relate the story to life's relationships and lessons.
 if you are one who enjoys an adventure that is out of this world's constraints than read this book.  it features a younger kid's adventure and may relate to a younger audience better, but older people can appreciate it as well.  if talking animals intrigue you, you might like this book.  if you can't stand things out of the ordinary this book is definitely not for you.",the magician's nephew,1080691200,A1288XI5LO0J76,Senior High
7226,3,"i hate to take away one star because of the way the publishers currently number the books, so i won't. however, i would like to question the reason for the re-ordering of the books. i'd hate to think it's because the publishers thought it would be easier for kids to understand, because each book makes it pretty clear when each story occurs (and the original sequence worked for a good 30 or so years; if it ain't broke, etc). also, the sense of mystery and discovery is taken away with the new sequence; the mystery of who the professor is, for example. for example, narnia is discovered by lucy. it is not mentioned, introduced or even described (initially)by the author. thus, the reader's discovery and sense of wonder comes by way of lucy's point of view. the word narnia isn't even mentioned till the second chapter. in ""magician's nephew,"" narnia is mentioned on the very first page.

the original sequence just works better. i see it thusly: the lion, the witch & the wardrobe is the first book; it serves as the introduction and ends with the kids coming back to their reality. the original second book is the classic sequel, essentially giving the fans what they want by having the original four heroes go back to narnia and help aslan kick butt. book 3, the voyage of the dawn treader, is a changing of the guard, somewhat, introducing a new human protagonist, eustace, to replace peter and susan pevensie, apparently now too old to visit narnia. book 4, the silver chair omits edmun and lucy (like peter and susan, now also too old to go back to narnia) brings back eustace and introduces his friend jill. book 5, the horse & his boy is a break from the author's previous trend of having kids visiting or revisiting narnia kids visiting & revisiting narnia and instead tells a story that happened under the original 4 children's reign. book 6, the magician's nephew goes back to the aforementioned trend of kids visiting/revisiting narnia but tells the story of the first time it ever happened. nephew is arguably the best book, but i think it's much better if read in its original place, which is 6th. the sense of discovery is just much stronger, in my opinion. book 7, the only book that keeps its original place, wraps it all up, bringing back all the human protagonists (sans susan).

so, in closing, i'll just say there's absolutely nothing wrong with the original sequence. it is, in fact, much superior. heck, the movies are allegedly going to follow the original sequence (they at least started with the right book).",the original order really is best *possible spoilers*,1072051200,A8IZXBE7J6RNJ,ApeLieUproar
7234,5,"there are many excellent reviews to be found here about these books.  probably, most people purchasing a hardcover edition of these books have already read them, love them, and likely have at least one paperback edition on their bookshelf already.  with the release the new movie (there was a previous bbc movie) interest has been rekindled.  this is a good thing for these are indeed books worth reading, rereading, loaning to a friend or ten, and then reading again.

on allegory, lewis stated elsewhere that his intention was to write a good story which contained within it elements of the great story.  these books are not strictly allegory; they are not a new pilgrim's progress (read the original, by the way, not modern versions).  they are great stories but they are not rewritings of the gospels, genesis, and the apocalypse.  you will find a redeemer, but no virgin birth.  you will find a traitor, but not a judas.  the world is sung into existence, but not in six days.  for anyone who has not read these books and is hesitant to do so because they dislike allegory, do not fear - these are first and last a great story.

on order, the debate on how best to read these seven books will likely never be resolved here or elsewhere.  i recommend the published order rather than the chronological for two reasons.  the first reason is because most great stories don't begin at the beginning - the past is filled in as you read along.  david copperfield aside, great stories typically bring us into it at a point where questions are raised, not answered.  starting with the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe does exactly this.  we enter the story wondering how this land lies within a wardrobe, why is there a lamp-post in the middle of a forest, and why do animals talk in this strange place.  the second reason i prefer the published order is because they read more logically that way.  by this i mean that while the magician's nephew refers to things we already know from the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, the reverse is not true.

personally, i'll look for a hardcover edition numbered in the published order, but whether i find one or not, i'll certainly read narnia again, and again, and very likely, again.",allegory and order,1064534400,A1198KRIRGK0E9,ubi caritas

majestic caer paravel--but in ruins!  ages have paased, but human greed, treachery and ambition are never out of style.

  young prince caspian, the true heir to the crown, needs the help of the four monarchs to rid narnia of his uncle/usurper.  even worse, men and talking animals alike doubt the ancient tales about aslan, the mighty lion from over-the-sea, who sacrificed hismelf on the stone table to save those whom he loved.  yet did not die.
  beneath the surface plot and childlike banter among siblings, defenders and scoundrels, scl has included many references to christianity--without mentioning god or jesus.  he also incorporates many mytholgoical creatures, which makes a curious literary blend.  it's a challenge to provide equal action for all four kids, but young lucy still enjoys a special rapport with her precious lion. sadly, this wil be peter and susan's last visit to narnia, since they are growing up. even edmund redeems himself after his treachery in the first book, but can you ever truly kill a witch?. prince caspian proves a fast, action-packed read for kids from 12 on up.",recalled by the horn!,1051228800,A1JTG5X4VHJV27,Plume45

i first read these books in third grade, and i struggle to get through this story.  today as an adult, i find it to still be my least favorite of the series.  too much of the book is spent giving background.  the story picks up in the second half, but it's not quite enough to redeem the first.  some of my original disappointment probably also comes from realizing that this was not the same narnia we left.  with the centuries that have passed between books, the four children and aslan are the only returning characters.  still, it's good to see them again, and a trip to narnia is always worth it.

7300,4,"""the magician's nephew"" is about more than just the creation of narnia. it is an exciting adventure story in its own right, though it does begin deceptively, dragging its feet.
digory kirke is the nephew; andrew ketterley is the magician; and polly plummer is the girl who lives a few doors down. the two children have been warned to keep away from eccentric uncle andrew, which they do gladly. one day, however, they accidentally enter his private study and get tangled in his mad experiment involving magical worlds.
here the adventure begins in earnest. digory and polly visit a ""deplorable world"" called charn and awaken the queen jadis. when they try to return to earth, jadis follows them, intending to conquer and rule their world, as she had conquered and ruled charn. in their desperate attempts to take jadis back to her own world, the children accidentally bring her--_and_ uncle andrew--into narnia, on the day of its birth.
what follows is the longest bit of narnian history since the story of the telmarines in ""prince caspian"" (unless you count ""the horse and his boy"", which _also_ preceded ""the magician's nephew"" in the original ordering). there is the creation of narnia, the selection of the talking beasts, the story of latern waste, the coronation of the first king and queen, and the entry of evil . . .
it is this history which makes ""the magician's nephew"" so wonderful. the history breathes new life into the narnia that readers (ought to) already know and love. learning about the creation of this magical world and about the past of the already-intriguing professor kirke of ""the lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" is most fun when one has already been to narnia and met professor kirke, so to speak.
there are other great things about this book, of course, such as the description of charn (especially the room of figures), the conversation of the animals, the subplot involving digory's mother, and many other elements. discover them for yourself and experience the magic.
what i like most about ""the magician's nephew"", however, is how a paradox of good and evil is twisted into the plot. we all know that digory and polly weren't supposed to have awoken jadis, much less brought her anywhere near narnia. yet it is precisely because they did it that narnia became so special. the paradox is that it took a sin--or rather, the forgiveness of a repented sin--to truly bless narnia.","read ""the lion, the witch and the wardrobe"" first!!!",1012867200,A27VJVE1SKAU8C,Amazon Customer

we get to see how narnia was in its ideal state, before the white witch entered and wreked havoc on the ideal land.  this book also shows us the ""structure"" of the narnia fantasy lands.  it shows us the difference between good and evil, bravery and cowardice, benevolence and destructiveness.

all children's literature contains an element of socialization, instructing the reader on what is proper and improper behavior.  lewis lays this on thick, with all the subtlety of a medieval morality play.  if lewis were not known for writing christian apologetics the moral relativism in these stories would bring them under as much attack as harry potter (heroic characters lie and steal).  character development is non-existent, and they aren't even well written (voice varies, without apparent pattern, from third person observer to third person limited omniscience with odd and distracting first person interjections).

7487,5,"this book, 90% informative and 10% humorous, equals 100% reading enjoyment. it's a delightful and entertaining history of delhi, india told in a very ingenious way: it runs in reverse pattern from conventional history books in that it starts with the most recent history first and then gradually works back into time, ending in the ancient. however, what i enjoyed the most was how the author always introduces some present-day aspect (an existing ruin or a living person) as background material on which he weaves his historical journey in and out of delhi's past and present. for example, a dr. jaffrey is his link to the red fort; a now very old indian-born english woman, alice, describes her associations with lutyens, the creator of new delhi; a pakeezah begum, a crown-princess and librarian, is one of the last surviving descendants of the mughal emperors and becomes the modern-day connection to history of the mughal dynasty; and the very decrepit residency tells you about delhi's romantic past in the era when it was beautifully intact.

i don't know why, but to me the most poignant stories told were about the anglo-indians who ended up abandoned by both britain and india after the birth of an independent india. i never realized such unfortunate people existed, becoming political refugees denied rights by india, the country of their birth; and by the uk, to which they had blood ties. mr. dalrymple interviews a few of these people who by now have grown old and are the living remnants of hardball politics of a bygone era. they give their personal accounts of their own hardships. as victims abused by the system, they were denied basic privileges. these interviews are still quite vivid in my memory.

in the midst of all the daunting history of this city, mr. dalrymple intersperses his daily experiences in the form of funny stories about his landlady and apartment; plus he pokes fun of the heat, the noise, the traffic, the driving--all the typical indian imageries that have been branded in our minds. while these did add diversion to the detailed history, my one fault with the book is that these incidents happened to be the same-ole, stereotypical situations that have been run to the ground about india. i was disappointed that he didn't exert a more pioneering in spirit and come up with more original subjects. nevertheless, he has a natural talent for describing comical situations (or do i mean describing situations comically?). in spite of this one criticism, i ended up with big smiles on my face many times. and his prowess at transcribing the english spoken in india to the tee can't help but put a grin on your face.

in summary, this is an excellent read just for the sake of learning about a fascinating place. i especially recommend it for history buffs and i heartily recommend it to familiarize yourself with delhi if it's on your list of travel destinations. i can honestly say that after reading city of djinns, i most definitely will invest my next time in delhi looking into some of the sites and districts brought to life in this book.",a fascinating work on a fascinating city,1124755200,A2GNVZUDL15YDK,Ronald Pompeo
7489,5,"i had heard of william dalrymple from various people who recommended that i read his books.

finally, while on an extended trip to bangalore, india, i picked up a couple of his books. i started with the ""city of djinns,"" since i had lived and studied in new delhi and was a history buff.

this book provides is a succinct history of the ancient city of delhi as seen through the eyes of the author who spent a year in delhi.

dalrymple peels back the layers of this old city in an interesting manner and gives us an interesting and dynamic  glimpse of what the city must have looked like then. what is interesting is that he unravels the past history of delhi through the eyes of informed denizens of the city. there is a tinge of nostalgia and poignancy when he unravels the history and introduces us to the old and fast disappering history and culture of delhi. in this process we get to read about the idiosyncrasies of lutyens (the britisher who envisioned and built new delhi), and we meet the last surviving members of the powerful mughal empire and how their existence is reduce to one of penury. we get an understanding of how the eunuch culture came into existence and how it continues to survive in modern day delhi.

since the book falls under the travelogue category, i would recommend this as a must read book for those who want to know more about delhi. the next time you visit delhi step away from the usual tourist circuit and explore some of the areas that dalrymple talks about in his book.

but, even if you are not traveling to india, this is a good read that helps us understand how cities are fast morphing into new entities and in this process a lot of the intricate social and cultural underpinnings of the society are being replaced by new social and cultural norms.",informative and engaging,1109894400,A1QGEKNC8E3X9U,&#034;KB&#034; Kamla Srinivasan

7549,2,"let me start out by saying i'm a huge fan of michael crichton. his books jurassic park and andromeda strain are classics. that said, his other work is hit and miss. he tended to work in a formula which didn't always gel: group of people trapped in a building with something scary. jurassic park was a hit. prey is definitely a miss for me.

despite claims on the cover and the description, this book is not really about nanotechnology. it's about killer dust. the premise is that a computer programmer discovers his wife has been leading a team to create microscopic robots, and the robots have escaped from the lab and become self-aware. when he goes to his wife's lab, he and the other scientists become trapped inside.

for most of the book, the robots take the form of swarms of dust that attack. not really a realistic representation of nanotechnology. i would compare it to verne's book on space travel, a book written about a technology that doesn't exist so is horribly misunderstood.

the killer dust is also really stupid as an enemy. to see a group of adult cowering in fear from piles of dust just didn't do it for me. sometimes, they do get trapped with it and ""oh no, it's in my eyes! it's in my nose! okay, i took a shower and i'm fine now.""

the opening of the book had some wonderful character development. one of the biggest criticisms crichton got is his weak characters. i thought he did a great job building a story around the main character, unemployed house husband. unfortunately, it all gets thrown away once the hero gets locked up in a lab, hiding from the killer dust.

towards the end, the killer dust becomes more interesting with a nest and pretending to be people, but i wish it had been that way from the start. and i also thought it was all pretty outlandish, nothing like what scientists now believe nanotechnology will become. some nice moments, but overall a disappointment.",killer dust isn't nanotechnology,1473552000,AN2HRLE3K65YU,Nigel G Mitchell

7787,4,"it is difficult to review a novel of the ""master"" without repeating myself, since, whatever the story, all his writings are characterized by the ability of gluing us to the pages until the end and on the other hand by the fact that they explore a new topic, always teaching us something new.
it also happens in ""prey"". the topic is nanotechnology and the theme of the scientific experiment that escapes from the hands of those who executes it. this latter issue is certainly not something new, but the point of view from which crichton decides to tell us the story is very special.
almost the entire novel (except, i believe, one scene), in fact, is told in first person by the husband of the scientist on duty, who for most of the book witnesses strange situations that he does not understand or interprets in the wrong way, thus keeping alive our curiosity, page after page, and by allowing us to find out the facts with him. an approach that helps a complete involvement in the reading.
yet unlike other novels i've read so far, i've ""just"" given 4 stars. the reason is perhaps personal: the topic of the swarm of nanoparticles has not impressed me at all. it does not mean that the author hasn't managed it in the best way. quite the contrary. the swarms, as he describes them, are really scary. but i found it a difficult topic to conceive, especially in respect of the final developments of story, but also the whole part, in which he explains a bit about the frontiers of nanotechnology (information based in part on actual studies confirmed by the bibliography and to which a lot of speculation and fantasy is added) has not won my full interest. maybe it depends on the fact that nanotechnology, at least in the way it has been presented in this book, did not appear very appealing to me. what missed, in short, as far as i'm concerned, was that part of the fun in the books of crichton that comes from learning something new, this is because i did not felt involved in the topic, therefore the book didn't leave too much to me after reading it.
he, however, remains for me a solid point of reference. i only regret that, once finished reading all of his books, there will not be others anymore.

7790,3,"prey is a science fiction drama that answers the question ""what would happen if a self-sufficient, violent ai went rouge?""

crichton's story answers while delivering a plot that keeps you busy in a bold, engaging style. i found it to be a fun read to finish in one or two sittings. in addition you can consider some of the cool implications of distributed computing and nanotechnology while you read.

however if you're looking for a story that challenges your observational skills or tests your philosophical inclinations, back off. this book is basically just action. the characters are simplistic and the only thing i was worried about was who would survive (other than the narrator).

on the other hand, not all novels are about in-depth characterization, so if you liked other crichton or clancy books, pick this up and prepare to enjoy. if you're going on a long airline flight this is also a good choice. have fun!

part of what bothered me was the style of writing. it seemed as though a complete oaf was speaking! every sentence was: i did this. then i said. i went. i know. i..i..i!!! i was going crazy with that! and of course there were paragraphs where i didn't understand half of the words because i am not knowledgeable in nano technology...but those paragraphs i could handle. it was the dull sentences with lack of word choice that made me cringe.

and just so everyone knows, i'm love all types of novels. some of my favorite have been light reads, so being deep is not a requirement. but writing in a captivating manner is.

aside from the style of writing, the story didn't really hold my attention. at times i was totally into what was happening, and then the topic would change and my attention would go with it. it was really unfortunate because i soooo wanted to like this book!

bought this story from someone and put his name on it"" or something to that effect.

this story just came across as pure crap. something i might expect from a 9th grader for a science fiction class.

one of the things i usually like about michael crichton's writing is the plausibility of what he talks about. jurassic park is a good example
of this. yeah, i know its a stretch that somewhere out there is a team of scientists looking to clone dinosaurs, but the science is there to do
cloning. so that's what makes it plausible to believe.

7841,3,"i almost gave this a four star review, it is better than a three. the thing i dislike about crichton is that he is dead. we are stuck with what he has written, the possibilities of new are zero. hence this review can only be based on what is written, not how it might be better. to speak in the past, too many of crichton's books are too fast paced for me, i only finish one episode when i am struck by another one maybe even more difficult, or more deadly, or even more impossible to surmount but somehow the protagonist does. the pacing in ""prey"" is about at the speed i like, i survive one encounter  in a believable fashion, no coincidences and there is a break in the action before the next problem occurs, time for conditions to settle, and the characters have time to adjust to the conditions surrounding them.
  jack forman starts out as an out of work manager with home and family problems. he enlists his sister as an aide, then things begin to happen. jack refuses to see things as they are, we are in first person recounting of events so we are only provided with events as seen by the protagonist. when jack misinterprets events, we can not change the interpretation, we are stuck with it. this helps determine the pace of events, jack does not have lightning fast reflexes. he does have a good interpretsaive ability so i can see how he became a manager, but from what he does from here on makes me think he is still a good programmer, he catches on fast to what is happening to a state of the art program.
  jack is recruited as a consultant to a defense contractor, xymose, to regain control of a nanotechnological device that has gone wild he is chosen because the recruiter believes jack has the necessaries to accomplish the desired end. but, unknown to jack, and not revealed to the reader, either, there are many forces at play, hidden desires and hidden motives for what looks like psychotic behavior. jack plods ahead and various forces are uncovered. xymose has lost government contracts, some of the employees want to move up in the company, make lots of money, and they need the company to come out with startling results. at the moment they seem to be fastened on to the leading edge technology.
  the wild component is destroyed, the domestic component strikes, jack's wife, julia, joins the fray, action picks up and some of the company employees reveal their true selves and all, except for mae, one of jack's former employees, are in league with each other and against jack. julia reveals she has infected her and jack's children and this knowledge drives jack hard enough to overcome his adversaries. we are near the end of the book here, time to quit before spoiling the read for others.",prey/predator is a mathematical function,1292198400,A1I00FDH0JK1RR,Melvin Anderson

7847,3,"i read it to the end (which is saying something) but didn't really think it was that good. i was left thinking it was intended as the skeleton on which to base a movie, or at least written with that hope in mind. i have to admit, i probably wouldn't have thought this if i didn't already know of michael crichton's relationship with hollywood. i also knew crichton was sympathetic towards the men's movement before picking this up.

i will say this book was very frightening. rather than creating the fear, i think crichton is tapping into something that is already there. he's building upon previous dramas and scenes we've all seen before at the movies which have frightened us - if he is not tapping into fears we have in the real world. i remember being frightened by the movie 'war of the worlds'. . . it frightened me even more the second time i watched it. i wanted to be afraid. perhaps it was some kind of therapy.

the story definitely has it's moments. when the main character finally connects with his wife (or ex-wife - can't remember) - it felt very real to me. it was a very powerful scene - it was a very moving part of the story. perhaps just for this, the book deserves 5 stars. as a work of literature i suspect this particular story struggles to earn 3 stars. i have felt this 'connection' or whatever before (no laughing at me, now). it's seems in these movies and stories with alien intelligences or with our machines turning against us, there's something there that can re-affirm our humanity. the story, 'i have no mouth and i must scream' did this too? - been a long time since i've read the story. the most effective i've seen this done on screen is in an outer limits episode, 'the human operators' - just occurred to me writing this review the sly possible double-meaning in the episodes title.

thinking back about the story (and thinking about things like the setting for some of the action scenes) and reading some of the plot synopsis's, this reaffirms my opinion 'prey' was written with the big screen in mind. i imagine this story will be made into a block buster one day. . .

others have summarized it, you can read those reviews as well as you can this one, so i will save time and point out what is right and what is wrong.

first, the good. the characterization is better here than it is in most michael crichton novels. this is refreshing, although he still can't write an intelligent and dynamic female character to save a novel. strangely. in any case, jack forman, our protagonist, is much more three dimensional than previous, and later, crichton characters. it was too bad that it was really a one-time thing.

the bad. the ending was lame. really lame. i saw it coming about halfway through the book. and it could have been so much better, too, which was even worse. also, all of the characters except for jack forman are awful. truly, jaw-droppingly bad. many of them are retreads from other books by crichton. as if his word file says, ""insert ubiquitous fat, obnoxious, computer expert guy here.""

the science in this one is also bad. no matter how you build nanotechnology, escherichia coli cannot live in the desert. it is too dry, there is too much uv light, etc. at least this time, though, the people who he has villainized are merely a single company, and not an entire business, like lawyers or molecular biologists. it is more reasonable that a half-dozen people could fall into the mental traps that appear in this book than the entirety of an academic discipline, which is just awful.

once, he visits the research lab, however, the book starts to get going, and the suspense starts to build, as they realise the enormity of the problem that they have on their hands, and the novel becomes a race against time, to destroy the nano particles. overall, a fairly good read, with a few twists, reasonably good characterisation, but, also, very 'technical' in places.",fairly good techno thriller,1214956800,A1G7NIRU8QR7MW,J.Flood

7873,3,"this review pertains especially to the unabridged audio book version of michael crichton's prey, read by george wilson.  (robert sean leonard performs the abridged audio book.)  i'll address first the reading, and then the story.

i have not really listened to a lot of books.  i'd always wondered if listening to a book counts as having ""read"" it, giving that absurd question far more thought than is worth.  one thing i've learned, though, is that despite not seeing the words on a page i retain far more of the story, even the author's language, than i had thought i would.  i guess that that's because, as the words are read, one paints the scenes in one's mind, and it's the vivid memory of those scenes, a memory both visual and auditory, that sticks--like old-time radio.

so let me comment on the auditory experience.  george wilson's baritone voice does a nice job with the narrative itself.  but is it common for a reader to try to give distinctive ""voices"" to the characters?  in particular, should a male reader attempt to ""put on"" a female voice?  and how about mimicking children: should an adult male reader of a book try to switch to children's voices?  this method of book reading might work well with a particularly good actor, but wilson's attempts fall short of the mark.  when wilson first started reading the words of an asian-american character, mae chang, in a soft, high voice, i started to laugh.  it just sounded alternately unintentionally seductive and silly.  and forget the arguments between the kids; it's like listening to an adult mock the way children talk.  far better for wilson just to have read the entire material in his own voice.

as for the novel itself, prey follows the formula first set out by michael crichton in the andromeda strain and developed much further in jurassic park.  the formula works quite well; it's like variations on an amusement park ride.  what makes crichton's novels particularly fun to read for someone who likes the ""science"" in ""science fiction"" is that crichton weaves in a lot of factual science material into his narrative.  at times, though, the way he weaves that material in can be borderline pedantic; what's worse is that it can destroy the flow of the story and diminish its effectiveness.

prey is essentially jurassic park with swarming hybrid nanomachine-microorganisms in place of dinosaurs.  (wouldn't the swarms have been a better title, incidentally?)  both stories involve technology that isn't too far removed from the present, and concern the havoc that results when human beings, full of hubris and highly fallible, attempt to play god.  the basic problem with prey's monsters is that they aren't a feature of popular culture.  and swarming dust doesn't immediately strike one as very terrifying.  crichton does a great job, though, at making these swarms frightening.  he builds the tension for a satisfying ride through what one would be forgiven for calling nanoland park.

there are problems with prey.  beyond the expected plot holes that suspension of disbelief wants to hide, the occasional hackneyed plot twists and interactions between characters, and the sometimes embarrassingly bad dialogue, prey takes far too long to get the story going.  a good first third of the book takes place in a home in which some strange things happen; developments that seem far less mysterious to the reader than they are to the--supposedly smart--characters.  the home scenes basically reveal that julia forman, the wife of the main character, jack forman, and the mother of two-going-on-three brats, is acting very strangely.  before the action even moves out to the desert--nanoland park--the reader already knows that julia is ""possessed"" by the evil nanoparticles; we just don't know how or why.  we are left to wonder about some of the other strange occurrences, while having to put up with arguments between the brats and, even worse, wimpy jack's inability to do anything with any kind of conviction at all.  not caring about the characters is not where the reader wants to be when the action begins.

however that may be, once the nanoland park ride begins, the story becomes compelling and fun.  (i knew i had got caught up in it when i hesitated to kiss my wife one evening!  you'll have to read the story to understand.)  it would make a good summer read, or, if you can put up with george wilson's varying ""voices,"" a good beach listen.  what gives this pulp fiction a kind of redeeming value beyond entertainment is that crichton occasionally also succeeds in making you ponder the world through the lens of science; for instance, he makes the point that our bodies in all their sum parts are essentially swarms of nanoparticles and that our mental activity is actually far more decentralized than what we might think.",a ride through nanoland park (eventually),1212624000,A30R23VXTBBTLN,M.

he's an imaginative guy, and his stories typically follow the tight-knit formula of a summer blockbuster movie...but the prose itself is disasterous.

hey, how bad could it really be, though?  i read this one from front to back.

it begins strong---i would tell anyone that the first half of the book is a solid read, but the writer quickly loses control of his story and it soon devolves into a cheesy action movie-slash-invasion of the bodysnatchers crapfest.

7884,2,"i was surprised to see that amazon has sold 815,000 copies of this book but that no one has reviewed it yet.  so i'll give it a shot.  i actually listened to the recorded books version rather than read the book.  out of work programmer, jack, starts to worry about how hard his wife julia is working at xymos. xymos is developing a swarm of nanoparticles with distributed intellegence for the military.  the application is military surveillance, the swarm will be used as a camera.  the details really don't matter.  after julia is nearly killed in an unexplained auto accident, jack is hired by xymos to help them with a programming problem. some of the programmers at xymos used to work with jack.  jack had developed a program called predpray for distributed intellegences and xymos told jack they were having problems with his program.  what jack finds is that the manufacturing facility, located way out in the desert, has lost control of several swarms of particles which are now living in the desert around the facility. and they are dangerous, killing local wildlife and reproducing.  needless to say, jack eventually saves the day.  i have two big problems with this book.  first, jack is pretty slow on the uptake.  it seemed pretty apparent to me that things were much worse at the facility then what jack was being told.  the whole story is told in first person perspective by jack so the reader is not aware of anything other than jack sees.  people at the facility whom jack knows, including his wife, are not acting like themselves.  and although jack questions this in his head, his suspicions are not translated into action until things start to get out of hand.  the other problems is that crichton seems to be treating his readers like they are a bit dim witted as well.  there were multiple explanations of the same concepts to the point where i was practically yelling at my cd player to get on with the story for god's sake.

and the ending was unsatisfactory.  too many loose ends.  when julia has her car accident (her car hurtles off a cliff and she is barely injured)  there was apparently a swarm in her car.  jack seems to realize this but gives no thought to what happened to it.  the car crash wouldn't have hurt it.  i guess we'll have to wait for prey 2.",yawn,1192924800,ASG9I1SOZ1WRQ,Clifford J.

7887,3,"i really admire michael crichton, who is able to tell exciting suspense stories while at the same time educating the reader about science, history, and a wide variety of other subjects.  at his peak, he has written some truly great novels, such as the great train robbery, sphere and jurassic park.

prey is a good suspense novel, but not a great one.  this novel deals with the dangers of nanotechnology, but i didn't really find the storyline particularly believable.  essentially, you have to believe that a monster has been created by nantechnology that possesses miraculous powers that border on the ludicrous.  in the end, i didn't buy the concept, which made this novel less enjoyable.

crichton also puts more emphasis on fast pacing in prey, at the expense of good characterization.  as a result, many of the characters are stereotypes and you barely get to know them.  the only exception is the lead character, who is likable enough that i cared about him a lot.  unfortunately, the ending doesn't provide the reader much closure with regards to his fate, which i found highly annoying.

in short, prey is fast-paced and fun, but it's not his best work.  i personally wouldn't recommend it to first time crichton readers.","enjoyable, but not his best",1185840000,A16QQ78I8J29PA,Thriller Lover

another miss for me. i got so bored with it that stopped and read another book just to prevent this one from putting me in a reading slump.

there were two storylines in this book, which merged at the end in a very predictable way. i'm not sure if the ""twist"" was really that predictable, or i'm just getting really good at guessing book endings.

i found one storyline (the one based in the past- so violent, so terrifying!) was a lot more captivating that the other (in present time). in the last 100 pages or so, i thought the storyline in the present was great! it was just a major bummer that it took so long to get there.

i didn't care for any of the characters at all, and i know i will have completely forgotten about them a day from now. even in the story, when the main character (grey) in the present was in serious danger, i didn't care one bit. which is upsetting... but perhaps why i didn't think this book was so scary? if i had really liked the character or felt a connection to her in the slightest bit, i may have found it to be more terrifying like many reviewers did.

i'm struggling with my review for this book because on one hand, i thought this book was creepy, but on the other i thought it was very drawn out and just plain boring. i'm not sure i would recommend it.

***possible spoilers below***

this book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:

1. anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)

2. there is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. in fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.

3. if you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the first thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.

4. nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. they say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. they also have the ability to bite.

the whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! the characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (ricky and julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.

plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? they're nanoparticles! if they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.

the biggest surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.

7921,2,"over the years michael crichton has provided some fine entertainment, but you have to wonder exactly when it became federal law that ""techno-thrillers"" must be stiff and awkward, serving up by-the-numbers storytelling, typecast characters and humdrum dialogue.  not zipping along, spirited and alive, and intelligent, but rather mechanically sputtering and clanking along bestseller trail, like, say, a big clumsy runaway swarm of self-sustaining nanoparticles on their way to absorbing their first desert bunny.

not that this killer-micro-robots-on-the-swarm idea isn't worthy, and just the sort of thing that humans would knowingly or unknowingly unleash. but, to take one example, the lead character is this cutting-edge evolutionary-nanoparticle predator-prey computer programmer, with kids, cute kids, and a wife, a very lovely wife.  after numerous strange occurrences (sure, there might be some short period of denial), wouldn't any one of us become hyper-alert, especially when family safety is involved? not our boy jack.  this savior of humankind seems more like homer simpson distractedly searching for a lost jelly doughnut.  why would such an intelligent writer create so torpid a hero?  because jack is everyman?  (wouldn't say much for crichton's view of everyman.) but then why make him so otherwise brilliant?

as far as the plot is concerned, it isn't as if there aren't some unique and fascinating ideas here, but once they are dropped down the hopper of the grinding techo-thriller-0-matic, what comes out seems so much like what we've trudged through before.  that crichton can take subjects this technically obscure and turn them into popular novels, then movies, is commendable. we definitely learn more about artificial intelligence, nanoparticles and predator-prey behavior. however, it would be helpful if such an accomplished author were to take at least half the energy he devotes to periodically stopping the action to explain arcane technology, and shift it to creating gripping, more believable plots, vivid detail (the more fantastic the story, the greater the need for convincing, if limited, detail), life-like idiosyncratic characters and crisp intelligent dialogue. this would allow new scientific concepts to filter down quietly, almost unnoticed, into the minds of readers who are deeply involved in the story.

i am so absolutely confused by this book.  i want to hate it but i don't hate it.  it wasn't exactly what i was expecting and i hate it because of that but it's not the books fault because i didn't read the summary.  i thought it was going to be more of a fictional biographical account of exactly what was going on in nanking but it really wasn't.  it was a suspenseful fiction about an idea of a specific event that happened in nanking.  i think it would have been a better tale from the eyes of the co-hero than an immature englishwoman that became obsessed with something she read in the book.

i couldn't put it down but at the same time i was too stressed to turn the page.  i knew it was only a matter of time before something went bad with the gangster, fuyuki, and before shujin met a terrible fate.  the main character, grey, drew me in with her broken soul, making me want to envelope her in a protective hug that deflects all bad things so she has the time to heal.  i feel the book could have done a better job at explaining the connection between her obsession with the live babies being cut out of mothers wombs in nanking to her own experience of self mutilation to ""save"" her baby.  chongming, i would love to read an account from his perspective.  about that fateful night in nanking; about his escaping; about his guilt, sadness, grief; about his quest to find fuyuki.  i think that would be a most interesting tale but probably gut-wrenching and horrible and sad - even more so than this original one.

i think this story is similar to a lot of his books, in the sense that the characters are trying to esape by getting off an island (or in this case a buidling), and that crichton uses the same ""nature/technology runs amok theme.""

i really liked the first 3/4ths of the book, then the last 1/4 was just...i don't know, what's the word...cheesy. i don't know if crichton had a deadline to meet, but the ending felt rushed. the whole ""invasion of the body snatchers"" part of the book has been done before, why oh why did crichton thought it would be good for this book?",were not talking nano ipods here.,1133827200,A2OWG2EL0A1E6Q,Richard King
7968,3,"as with many crichton books, this one has an interesting premise based on a few nuggets of science. when we finally get real nanotechnology working, it could well pose more threat than promise. ""gray goo"" isn't really new territory for science fiction, but crichton's depiction of the manufacturing process and software and biology background here are impressive and instructive. the ""nest"" where the nano-based creatures are reproducing is also impressive, though far less believable.

the novel is severely marred by the first-person perspective. there's no real character development, and the facets of the character that are shown are poorly integrated. unfortunately here the narrator and prime actor is a perplexing figure, in many respects unreal, though crichton tries hard. if he still loves his wife, why does he seem to have no regrets at the tragic ending he himself brings about? if he's so smart, why does it take him such an awfully long time in the book to see what is obviously going on around him?

and the plot itself has many elements that are hard to take seriously. self-organizing nanoparticles are one thing, but the way they develop day by day with one behavior after another is quite unbelievable; even more so at the end when behaviors of another sort in cooperation with humans are revealed. what possible purpose would such a progression have for the organized nano-creatures? crichton seems to be pushing concepts of evolution through selection pressure, but it cannot possibly work at anywhere near the speed he depicts here.

but the book is certainly an interesting read, and doesn't disappoint in the way of suspense and plot, despite the unreality of much of the situation that comes up. not a bad effort, but it's not going to give me any new nightmares about ""gray goo"".","thrilling, but not realistic",1133222400,A33ZXAWI4HFY5V,Arthur P.

7989,3,"once again, michael crichton uses one of his plots to warn human civilization against the evil that can possibly come from new technology that we don't fully understand. he did it in the excellent ""jurassic park"" - his best book so far, in my opinion - and in ""sphere"". but now the results are far from what i expected.

this time it's nanotechnology instead of dna manipulation and dinosaurs. there is a close environment, also an island of sorts, an isolated facility in the middle of the nevada desert. the villains of the story are swarms of nano-entities that were supposedly intended to help during medical procedures; but these swarms, whose behaviour is dictated by a computer code, have evolved and ran away on their own. nobody knows how they did it and nobody knows what they'll be capable of. a group of scientist and computer wizzards are called to get them back before god only knows what kind of destruction the evil swarms are planning to do.

nanotechnology is fascinating, but crichton's book is not. crichton recently seems to be suffering from johngrishamnitis, a disease that attacks the creative part of authors that used be great a little while ago. ""prey""'s plot is very thin, the characters were all the same to me - divided between the good ones and the bad ones - and all that happens in the book seems to follow a mediochre hollywood script. sure, there are thrilling parts and chapters in the story, but i knw from experience that crichton can do way better than this.

everything from the beginning is predictable, if you've read crichton before. the perfectly normal start, then the high tech link person or persons, the tech breakthrough somewhere around a third or the middle of the book, and finally everything going haywire towards the end. and oh, the mandatory dead people. this time, it's nanorobots which do the killing.

crichton's artificial life forms seem to have everything, from vision to inbuilt memory. he goes on adding visual sophistication, audio response, solar power generators and blah blah whenever something become difficult to explain. ai learning? no problem!! they have memory.

it isn't that the premise lacks timeliness - nano-manufacturing is becoming a very realistic process. it may just be that i know very little about diseases and the cloning of dna and a lot about micro-machines. working in the area of software agents that ""swarm"" within computer networks and learn through group experience, we humans can make the ""software"" only so smart. building micro, self powered, flying devices that can monitor air quality or send video feeds back to remote ""observers"" - not controllers - are moving out of laboratories and into field testing today. but, we are far, far away from the premise of prey.

grey has left her graduate program to continue researching a mysterious film that documents one of her obsessions. her obsession is the japanese occupation of nanking in 1930s. grey has found out that a film might have been shot of the nanking massacre. determined to find the film, she sets off to tokyo to find a chinese professor, shi chongming, who is teaching there that might know where the film is.

grey isn't a warm and fuzzy character. in fact, there are no warm fuzzy characters in this book. hence why i called them dark earlier - there are no bright characters and one of the only characters i found even slightly refreshing was strawberry. strawberry is the owner of a teahouse called ""some like it hot"" where grey ends up working to help stay in tokyo. she was quirky and i didn't find her as dark as everyone else - including grey. the characters all have the flaws which in part fits the topic of this novel but at the same time, really hurt my ability to connect or care for any of them.

8026,3,"i walk away from prey with mixed feelings.  admittedly, i was entertained by the book, but when i look back i feel somewhat tricked.  prey reminded me of something that i did often in college - i'd get so hungry that i would seek out and consume an entire meal of exceptionally low-quality food; only upon finishing would i realize that it sort of sucked.  it certainly seemed good at the time.  in the case of prey, mostly the entire thing was devoured at such a pace that i hardly noticed the book's occasional ridiculousness, particularly near the end (kisses of death?), nor did i really mind the thin characters (and thinner enemy).

if that was all there was to say about prey, i would have been pretty disappointed.  fortunately, the book's look at various interdisciplinary sciences and technologies definitely held my attention.  yes, it is a mostly negative portrayal of artificial life and nanotechnology (though crichton never mentions it by name, the doomsday grey goo scenario definitely inspires this work) and yes, the events that take place here are over-the-top, but let's not fool ourselves - this is science fiction.  you could make an argument that one function of good science fiction is to get us to reflect on the impact that technology has/could have on our lives, despite how exaggerated and unrealistic the claims may be (hence fiction).

in prey, everything is oversimplified (it has to be) and at times way too much liberty is taken with emergence (think: ""what?  the swarm can now ______?!  it must be emergent behavior!"").  ironically, i found that what really drove the book was, in fact, the emergence and evolutionary computing aspects - these were way more intriguing than the nanotechnology or prey's thesis of unintended consequences.

crichton weaves all of this into a suitable storyline... i wouldn't say a ""good"" storyline, but it works, and it holds your interest for sure.  you weren't going to read this book for the colorful characters anyway, much like how i, in college, wasn't eating that greasy pizza for its rich, exotic flavors.  i was eating it because it was quick and tasty, and as i mentioned, prey is a fast read and serves up some tasty ideas (many science-based, and many fiction-based).  ultimately, this is what makes it safe for consumption.",beach reading,1116201600,A1K5NCN1T2DSNB,Christopher R.

  that being said, prey is an average science fiction novel at best.  the science is viable but the story lacks a real hook.  the characters are one dimensional and very stereotypical.  i really did not care for or relate to any of the characters.  crichton has the ability to scare the reader with the most evil potential of a technology.  he has a gift to see a worst case scenario and create a character, eventhough one dimensional, that has the ability to survive this technology gone wild.

  this book was enjoyable and the ending was clever.  it did not get to pager-turner status until the middle to end.  the book did have a nice flow and was written in an after actions report type format that was interesting.  the only bog downs in the story is when crichton is explaining some elementary techno babble (what is a nanobot anyways?).

  this book may do well for fans of thrillers or as an intorduction to sci fi, but the experienced sci fi fan will see this book as lackluster.  i say save your money for the movie when it comes out.",lacks real character.,1112918400,A1PQTL9OQLEOVK,Budd

8042,2,"read this one on a glowing recommendation from my cs 511 prof - which just goes to prove just how stupid the academic elite can be.  (hey, i just proved dr. crichton's point and i didn't even have to create a race of super-powered machines to do it.)  i'm just glad i got it out of the borders bargain rack instead of paying list for it.

warning - here be spoilers...

1) the characters are flatter than lavash bread.  jack is the put-upon saint, julia is the career-chasing harridan, ricky is the too-slick corporate type, and so on.  i've read better characterization in ""xena: warrior princess"" fanfiction.

2) oh-so-convenient plot twists.  the techie gurus involved in the xymos project just happen to need an expert on evolutionary programming, which jack just happens to have pioneered, so they just happen to fly him out to their top-secret research lab which just happens to be 160 miles from nowhere in the nevada desert.  sorry, that's just a little too much coincidence for my diet.  oh, and by the way, dr. crichton:  you've done the science run amok thing many, many times before, and considerably better.  find a new hobbyhorse, please.

3) shoddy research - and since this is allegedly crichton's forte, this upset me more than anything.
* please pick an element - either the nanobots are carbon or silicon.  if they're c, there's no reason to eat the memory chips; if si, no reason to eat bunnies/snakes/humans.  (then too, if silicon was all they wanted, why only take the memory chips and leave the cpus and such alone?)
* the 'bots should never have been able to survive their own manufacturing process.  we know from the first few chapters that a hospital mri will kill them, and those typically run at 1-3 tesla.  a 33-tesla magnetic field, pulsed or not, would fuse any nanoscale metallic assemblage into unusable slag, to say nothing of frying pretty much any electronically based memory storage system.  (my palm gets scrambled whenever i walk inside the 10-gauss limit of the chem building's nmr unit - that's only .001 t.)  all they would have had to do to kill the 'bots permanently would be to pulse that sucker a couple times.
* phage viruses do ugly things to bacteria, but they wouldn't touch any non-bacterial organism - like, oh, a 'bot.
* crichton's handling of computer programming hasn't improved any since ""jurassic park.""  when jack goes code-diving into the 'bots' programming, i was painfully reminded of the bs hacking displayed by the kids (it was tim in the book, lex in the movie.)

4) as a previous reviewer said, plot holes a t. rex could stroll through.  the last chapter (i refuse to call it a conclusion) raises more questions than it answers.  the just-happens-to syndrome also recurs in full force.

the only thing that saved this book from a complete pan?  one of the programmers is depicted as wearing a ""ghost in the shell"" t-shirt.  (for those who've never hung out with an anime otaku or watched late-night cartoon network, gits is a famous japanese animated drama, which began as a graphic novel and spawned two animated movies and a tv series.  it deals with a computerized world in which a rogue program evolves to sentience within the internet, and how it interacts with the human world.  gits was the inspiration for ""the matrix,"" and it's also one of my favorite anime series.  dumb, but true.)

speaking of which, i think i'm going to go throw my copy of ""ghost in the shell"" into the dvd player.  at least mamoru oshii dealt with intelligent machinery, well, intelligently.",poor effort from an author who should know better,1109808000,AYCOR5XRUOG6J,Lindsay Murphy
8043,3,"crichton didn't go far enough in his vision of what nanotechnology is really capable of. granted, in the book, nanotechnology is brand new and so we don't get to see it in all its glory, but we are led to believe that it is good only for turning once-well adjusted people into evil superhuman zombies. i don't have a problem with technology being corrupt, but the direction crichton takes us in, i thought, is a tad juvenile and could easily have been concocted by an eleven-year-old.

despite this drawback, the book was phenomenal for the first third. i found the stay-at-home-dad protagonist to be crichton's most sympathetic, fully-fleshed, totally relatable character, and it was moving how emotionally confused he is at the prospects of his fantasy marriage falling apart. he's depressed. he's tired. he's flawed. he's human.

then, as soon as he visits the xymos research compound, he morphs into a typical crichton square-jawed-walking-encyclopedia-macgyver who is familiar with every single study conducted in the field of science and every paper written in any academic science journal since the dawn of mankind. and of course he can recall every last obscure detail from any of these studies and papers in a matter of nanoseconds. and all this from a guy who's been out of work for half a year. for once i'd like to see a crichton protagonist declare, ""i have no freakin' idea what's going on here!""

the storytelling is a little sloppy. he throws us all these mysterious, gripping clues and hints and then leaves you wondering about them until the last handful of pages. basically it's: ""you remember all those mysterious and gripping clues earlier in the book? well, here are their explanations. number one . . ."" i enjoy the mystery, but not how the mystery is revealed.

i'm probably being too harsh. did i enjoy the book while i was reading it? a resounding yes. a critic wrote that prey is crichton's most ""cinema-ready"" novel. while i disagree, it's certainly one of his strongest.

8048,3,"this book was extremely difficult for me to get into.  the prose was leaden at first and i almost gave it up.  but the good reviews i'd read made me curious enough to continue.  it got easier to read, but for the most part this author's style was not for me.  there were two exceptions:

one is that the author can write suspense.  there were some sections of the book with hefty doses of it, and it was done well. every so often i'd hit one, and it's what kept pulling me along toward the end.

the other is at the end, when the explanations fall into place.  it was well done, and affective (yes, that's the spelling i wanted).

still, for the most part, the plot and characters are what i consider to be pulp.  as such, it's entertaining to read, outrageous, titillating, extreme in order to capture attention, but it's not realistic.  none of the side characters are to be mistaken for real humans; they're defined by their eccentricities, not anything i could identify with, except perhaps fear. the plot seems just this side of a sci-fi conspiracy novel, though by the end you see it is not.

so all in all this was a mixed bag. once i realized that this was a dressed-up pulp novel, i sat back and enjoyed it.  i'm glad i read it, but a reader should go into it not expecting literature, but rather just a good tale that it may take a little while to get into.","tokyo, a mixed bag",1266019200,A2EKJOB8XFS4WK,Amazon Customer

8053,2,"to manufacture the paper of this novel's pages.

it's discouraging to write an unfavourable rev given the high praise this book has won, both from other reviewers and from authors who write relatively good books and should know better (i.e. connelly in the inside blurbs. i conclude that either they are paid to say what is reported, or that they have no taste whatsoever, or else that there is a kind of 'guild solidarity' among thiller's and mistery book's authors, as there is for example in the medical profession about colleagues' malpractice). of course this is my debatable opinion.

the main character is grotesquely unbelievable: an english girl who had a totally implausible sequestered childhood (in a ""crumbling cottage, where no roads came and no cars passed [p. 25], ...[with] the laxity creeping into [the] home, coming from the weed-choked windows, slinking past the damp piles of paperbacks""), with a mother that ""wouldn't trust a school not to fill my head with the wrong things so for years i was educated at home ... [with her mother] sometimes ripping offending pages from novels [pp. 18/19]"". when she's 13 years old, she unwittingly commits an implausible, and to her eyes atrocious, act; then leaves home and -the book is very vague here- schools herself in chinese and japanese in the hospital ward (or perhaps she does it earlier or later); she doesn't graduate from (but at least gets to second year of) london university; and she's always haunted by a japanese atrocity committed during the 1937 'rape of nanking' [a real historical episode] she had read about at home in an ""orange book"" the mother wrote to her ""i am sure you believe this book exists, but let me promise you this, you didn't read such rubbish in my house[p. 18]"" and she can't find anywhere else. so when she stumbles upon an indirect clue to a document about the atrocity, she hops on a plane and flies to japan [at twenty? twenty six? what's clear is that she's spent almost half her life (""nine years, seven months and eighteen days"": my, is she obsessive!) studying the massacre] ""with a fistful of yens [she earned] packing frozen peas in a factory, wearing away the skin on my fingers"" (p. 24), to interview an old chinese professor who maybe knows something about what really happened in 1937.

[by the way, hayder has this common but annoying trait among semi-literate writers of confusing ""to promise"" with ""to assure"".]

then our heroine is in japan, and presto!: she is transformed from a bumbling, incoherent wretch haunted by her childhood memories into a normal woman, who is to boot a desirable japanese club hostess (together with two russian prostitutes and acquiring an attractive white male lover in the process) and ultimately into an almost james bond-feminine- equivalent, foiling the most experienced thugs of the japanes mafia, assisting the professor, and in the process finding the truth about the 1937 episode and becoming reconciled with her inner demons.

about half the book consists of the chinese professor's 1936 diary, which is an attempt to create a creepy atmosphere by describing key events -and many unnecessary fillers, among them detailed topographical descriptions of certain parts of the city- in an oh so pompous and (failed) doomsday style, but that imo fails to deliver any suspense, so that you could replace it with two pages of narration and throw away the rest. you therefore have two main characters: the english girl/club hostess/mafia-buster, and the witness to the 1936 events. the alternate narrations (both in the first person) should provide variety, but the 1936 part is at times almost comic (i mean, the professot is so naive as to sometimes sound unreal).

a book to avoid. if you purchased it and read it, then, like me, you have utterly wasted yout money and your time. i awarded a second star for the research, but on second thought that's useless: who has't read about the (real part of the) japanese atrocities in general and the nanking massacre in particular? and as for the parts about tokyo nightlife, and the japanese gangsters, there are a host of better, more detailed book you can find here at amazon by simply typing the words.

warning: more comment but possible spoilers ahead!

the plot (assuming it can be said to exist) is contrived, and its leitmotiv is clear from about page 30 onwards. there is an additiona ""twist"" at the end that becomes evident by two clues: one somewhere before p. 150 and the other somewhere after p. 210 (exact numbers omitted so an not to spoil completely).

my opinion? by any means, don't buy this book. if you purchased it and didn't read it, donate it to a paper recycler. in both cases, if you want a ""atrocities"" replacement, read instead the far superior ""tropic of night"", by gruber.","the true victims are not the book's, but the trees some devil felled",1232236800,A30WRE5N6JRFJZ,"WB, Zeno"

8057,3,"prey is a novel about the possible consequences of nanotechnology going wrong. crichton very cleverly describes how nanotechnology, molecular biology and computer technology (ai) will fuse in the nanotech world. he does careful research and the arguments are presented by the protagonist who is a project manager in the nanotech world.

the book describes how one application of nanotech will be based on a predator-prey system, which will be modeled upon animals in the real world (like a colony of ants). such systems may not have a central intelligence (like humans or a company) but instead have collective intelligence based on simple rules. it is a largely a tightly written book, quite well paced and the characters are real. the appendix at the end provides references to seeming interesting material on nanotech - both technical and social from scientists working in the field. every book i have read written by crichton has been interesting and i have learned something from it. but then it is just my bias towards someone who is a dr from harvard and very well travelled? in any case, i enjoyed it and look forward to the next one!","fast paced book where nanotech, biotech, and ai meet",1107302400,A3HFQ09AOOWNVU,Shalin Chanchani

i thought this whole ""nanotechnology"" business was fascinating...i couldn't get enough of it. as you're reading, you yourself will imagine dozens of horrific ways this sort of stuff can go awry. thinking back to ""jurassic park"", he does something similar: a cutting-edge, just-in-the future technology that has one obvious but still quite interesting focus (dino-dna cloning), and then takes you on a rollercoaster that springboards from that initial conceit.

this book has that locomotive start. you learn more and more about these swarms and computing technologies that seem ominous and powerful and mysterious.

then, and fairly suddenly, the plot devolves into a sub-standard b-movie scenario.

ooh...run outside! quick! get back inside!

i dunno...i just expected so much more from the way this novel opened...something more disturbing, i guess. it seems that the misuse of what crichton describes could go so way beyond what is conjured here, this seems slight.

8059,2,"after reading most of crichton's books, it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books. with such books as 'jurassic park', 'the andromeda strain', and 'disclosure' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run.

this book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano-technology. crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject. i think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book.

the story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities. it is hard to believe some of the books imagery. this may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano-technology.

this could actually happen, if people with the right combination of scientific expertise and moral stupidity make crucial discoveries and ignore long-term consequences in favor of solving short-term problems. crichton sells his readers on believing this, consistently, as prey's plot builds through the book's first half and then explodes into action. after that it's a wild ride, indeed.

in parts, the novel dragged on a bit - with long winded scientific descriptions that i found myself skimming over. these were usually sumarised in layman's terms at the end of the two pages of scientific mumbo-jumbo with comparisons to simple things like corn.

8073,3,"this sci-fi thriller follows a computer programmer as he confronts a terrifying organism which his company unwittingly created when experimenting with nano-technology and micro-biology.  this first person narrative is somewhat boring in that the main character (the narrator) is not at all an intriguing personality.  he seems cold; he does not express the emotions warranted of man in his situations and thus does not evoke the corresponding emotions in the reader.

as usual with crichton there were also several explanatory gaps in the science behind the story.  when crichton runs into a difficult spot regarding the scientific particulars he tends to rush the narrative past that point or else he simply ignores it.  thus the reader remains unsatisfied for the remainder of the story and feels somewhat cheated for the sake of simplicity.  a particularly large gap in this story comes when the organisms interact with certain characters.  this event is central to the plot, but crichton never attempts to offer even a theoretical explanation of how or why this complicated and unlikely event takes place.

nevertheless, the story moves along a fair pace throughout most of the novel, and crichton's style, while not remarkable, makes for an entertaining read with enough suspense and intrigue to get you through a cross-country flight.  in comparison with crichton's other novels which i have read this ranks near the bottom, better than airframe but not as good as timeline, sphere, andromeda strain, or jurassic park. i give it a c.",not crichton's best,1101859200,A13XAFJR2D3AH,Stephen Coulon

it seems like crichton has become somewhat formulaic in this book. the book clearly mimics many of the themes, plots, and cliffhangers from jurassic park, but lacks the overall threat of 60 foot tall t-rex ready to rip your throat out. it's hard to develop suspense in a novel where the main threat is microscopic (although it was done in 'strain effectively, so why not here?)

8087,3,"a repeated theme in michael crichton's ""prey"" goes something like this: ""things never turn out the way you think they will."" i find myself wishing that this were true of the novel itself. ""prey"" is a novel that only michael crichton could have written, and that comes with both the good and the bad.

crichton's plot, timing, and his ability to keep a story clipping along at a brisk pace are all in evidence here. michael crichton books are sometimes better than others, but he rarely fails to entertain or to keep the reader engaged while they are reading. his book are usually fast reads because of this, but they also exhibit that crichton researches his subjects well, and incorporates that background material into the story without sacrificing the pacing of it. ""prey"" is par for the course by these standards.

unfortunately, it's also par for the course in other ways as well. the characters are thin at best, the themes are ones we've seen before in crichton's work (most obviously in ""jurassic park""), and the ending is weak. the book also suffers from a rather poor development about halfway through -- it's something i shouldn't give away (even though it's telegraphed pretty obviously early on), but suffice it to say that crichton had the opportunity for a really frightening antagonist in ""prey,"" but sold that potential short in a rather unbelieveable way, and made for a rather bland conflict in the end. again, all things we've seen before from michael crichton.

crichton likes to write about new technology trends, and in ""prey"" he turns his attention to nanotechnology. more specifically, self-evolving artificially-intelligent nanotechnology which (of course) breaks free of its creators and threatens life as we know it. if it sounds familiar, that's because it is -- ""prey"" is basically ""jurassic park"" warmed over, the same themes in a slightly more modern package. the dangers of science unchecked, the corporate world and the scientific one make poor bedfellows, human ingenuity can often outsmart itself, and so on. yes, very familiar indeed... which i wouldn't have minded if these themes were expressed in a better book.

""prey"" is a fair book. it's entertaining but light. the pacing is good but the characters are only crudely drawn. its potential exceeds its execution. if we must compare it to other crichton books (and in this case, i think such comparisons are inevitable), then ""jurassic park"" is a better book: more suspenseful and a more honest expression of the same themes.

8102,3,"i am a huge michael crichton fan, especially of his books.  they are much better stories than their movie counterparts (jurassic park is a perfect example of that).  however, his last few books have purely been written for the screen.  ""prey"", sadly, is no exception.
this story is about nanotechnology and how the creators get overrun by the monsters they create.  like in most of crichton's other books, it's very fast-paced supported by science that is somewhat controversial.  it begins very quickly and has few slow sections, especially if you are interested in nanotechnology.  however, it eventually slows down and ends anti-climactically.  the characters were flat and could not keep the story going once it reached its end.
sadly, crichton has written another book designed to become a movie screenplay.  if you read it as such, you may find it interesting.  it is fairly fast-paced and can be read in a few days.  however, if you're looking for a story to stand on its own merits without the underlying pretense of ""this is going to become a movie"", then you'll be disappointed.","good screenplay, not a good book",1089504000,AU9TCNOQQTJ58,Marcos Helms

in one case he talks about the nanobots eating out the carbon substrate from memory chips but not processor chips.  excuse me! what makes processor chips so different from memory chips, that nanobots only attacked memory chips? and if that wasn't bad enough, memory chips happen to be made of silicon! where in the hell do you get carbon from a silicon wafer?
then there's the case where he explains how the swarm will be tagged with radioactive selenium in a glucose mixture.  i'm sorry, this is a basic technology in radioactive tagging that was completely befuddled.  crichton has a degree from harvard medical school.  there is no excuse for getting these principles wrong.

8118,3,"if you don't have time to read crichton's new novel ""prey,"" drive over to the neighborhood video store and rent ""the andromeda strain,"" a 1970 movie based on crichton's early novel of the same title.  the story lines are essentially identical-virulent agents are released into the atmosphere and wreak havoc on hapless humans in their paths until the agents are (presumably but not definitively) destroyed.  the old story features alien biological microbes that continually mutate through a deadly pathogenic form into a benign form that escapes from the lab and  disappears over the ocean, while the new story features molecular level machines engineered through human nanotechnology.  the old story has the malevolent agents intentionally brought to earth via a military research satellite while the new one has them intentionally released from a laboratory in an attempt to force their evolution into a form desired by the researchers.  if there is anything new in ""prey"" that was not in ""the andromeda strain,"" it is the contribution that corporate greed makes to the near-destruction of humanity.
the resurrected three-decade-old plot still plays well in its new attire as a fun story intended for nothing more than escapist reading.  crichton does include an introduction that attempts to give the novel the appearance of a social commentary, warning that humanity may be developing technology that it is too ignorant to control.  so what's new?  humanity did that back in the 1940's with its ill-starred development of nuclear weapons.  certainly, there are novelists writing in the science fiction genre who provide outstanding commentary on the human condition.  zenna henderson (author of ""the people"") comes to mind as a prime example.  crichton, however, is not one of them, nor does the bibliography (an unusual addition to a sci-fi novel) turn ""prey"" into a serious examination of technological versus social progress.
underneath its veneer of social commentary, and despite its repetition of a thirty-year-old story line, ""prey"" emerges as a simple excursion into a brief but entertaining fantasy adventure.  after something of a slow start, the story begins picking up its pace until the reader is fairly running along with the unfolding events.  now and then, a repetitious comment does appear, and the occasional commentary on algorithms and nanotechnology research does put on the brakes, but by and large the story forges ahead at a seldom-slackening pace.
the ending is not totally satisfactory.  whereas, ""the andromeda strain"" pretty well assures us of the natural destruction of the mutated microbial cloud, leaving only the smallest doubt in the mind of the viewer or reader, ""prey"" leaves quite a few loose ends flapping about. we are left wondering if our hero/protagonist ""jack"" is entirely rid of the infesting nanogizmos, if his children have rid themselves of the little buggers, how his sister even got exposed, whether mae has the good news that her smile suggests, ands where the heck bob woodward is to expose all of the corporate evildoers (at least those who haven't died) on the front page of the washington post.  look, real life is full of loose ends, but when we read an escapist fantasy like ""prey,"" we want those ends nicely tied up at the end.  oh well, the book should make for a marvelous ""grade-b"" movie script, and i'll probably even pay to see it-but not at theater prices.  this will be one more  movie that will have to come out on cheap home video before i'll spring for the admission price.","""andromeda strain"" revisited",1085961600,A3J0OXB9KIC5SS,WILLIAM H FULLER
8124,3,"well, mc is allowed to write a so-so book every once in awhile - and this is it. if anything, i would normally be accused of going too easy on crichton, since he's probably my favorite contemporary author. i've read all of his books, including the john lange and michael douglas pseudonym novels, and i saw some uncharacteristic errors in ""prey.""
first, ""prey"" is written in first person, and i don't particularly enjoy his first person writing (case of need, rising sun, etc.). it's not just a style preference - it actually stems from crichton's intrinsic writing style. as any of his readers know, what makes his writing so amazing is his ability to seamlessly integrate in-depth research into fiction. however, the first person perspective naturally limits a writer's freedom to do this, and in crichton's writing this tends to lead to awkward inner-reflections and cumbersome bursts of dialogue. while ""prey"" manages this far better than say, ""rising sun,"" it still limits what is arguably the best reason for reading crichton to begin with.
second, this is the one novel where i would surrender to his more ardent critics that the ""technology"" portion of the novel competed with the plot. in past novels the unbelievably deep science has been woven into the story with amazing clarity, and the technology serves the story itself (jurassic park, timeline). in ""prey,"" however, i found in more than any other novel that crichton was using a contrived and cookie-cutter plot as a soapbox to enlighten us on scientific ethics, in this case artificial intelligence. the plot is simple and in my opinion jaded - scientist screw up, release something bad into nature, it needs to be contained...i've already read ""the stand"" and ""outbreak."" while crichton normally takes the normal and elevates it to the sublime, in this case he didn't. the plot was nothing more than the obvious outcome of a given situation. the science was also much more complicated than in previous works and i would imagine the average reader will be lost throughout much of it, or at least struggling so hard to understand nanotechnology they'll miss the relevance to the story.
third, the dialogue is off. thinking back throughout his works, i realized that crichton hasn't written many teenagers. this book shows us why. there are sections of the teenagers' dialogue that are literally embarrassing to read. example: ""...i'm trying dad. but he is a majorly turkey (...)."" ""i am not! up yours, weasel poop!"" no it's not a typo - ""a majorly turkey (...)."" i don't know if crichton (or his editor) has actually spoken to a teenager in the last 25 years, but in my experience no kids - nor any other human being i've ever known - actually talk like this. the teen dialogue is utterly unacceptable.
these are the major problems with the novel, and i feel it's at the bottom of crichton's efforts. if you're a fan it's definitely worth reading, but for me it just didn't have that special thing that all his other novels have.",nanobots and nanoplots,1083888000,A38G64S5VMRI1P,Robert Graves

8131,3,"in ""prey"" michael crichton treats us to another book cooked up from his trademark recipe for a thriller -- an array of scientific and technical facts stacked up to dizzying heights and arranged in always surprising combinations, sympathetic characters trying to save their own necks, and the world, from man-made catastrophe, and lots of running and screaming.
in ""jurassic park"", crichton asked what happens when genetic engineers, paleontologists, and theme park designers get together to talk about money making ventures.  here, the villainous technologies are genetic engieering, computer science, and nanotechnology.  he brings all these elements together in ""prey"" to give us a great piece of mind candy.  though not great literature, and not even ""jurassic park"", ""prey"" is still entertaining page turner.
there are a couple of problems with the book.  first of all, it's just not as thrilling to read a story about someone being chased across a parking lot by a big gray cloud of nanoparticles as it is to read about someone running from a t. rex through a jungle.
the science is also a problem.  crichton's science is ultimately wrong in most of his books, but his rapid-fire use of a huge number of facts can often make a believer out of almost anyone.  the illusion wears a little thin in ""prey"", though.  ""how did the nanoparticles learn to do that?""  ""well, they're controlled by a neural net, of course.""  ""oh yeah.  well, how could they learn so quickly?""  ""they're programmed to evolve much faster than natural organisms.""  ""oh yeah.""  of course, i'm exaggerating, but the level of scientific discourse is far too handwaving to satisfy ""jurassic park"" fans.
so, it's an ok read, and it would (will?) make another great movie.  buy it if you just have to have everything that crichton writes.  buy it if you just want something to pass the time.  but don't buy it if you're looking another ground breaker like ""jurassic park.""",a good read it is.  jurassic park it ain't.,1081209600,A8DMT4SCTANWI,Bob

that's pretty much the tale of prey---instead of dinosaurs, the menace consists of a ""swarm"" of nano-sized computers created by a silcon valley hardware/software company that again have gotten out of control.

the story is told in the first person by jack, the husband and temporary mr. mom of his family---wife julia works tediously long hours at xymos---the computer firm experimenting with nanotechnology.  jack senses something odd about his wife's newly found vehemence for her job and suspects an extramarital affair.  it is only when he is hired as a consultant to iron out some of the bugs in software procedures written by a team he managed at another company and purchased by xymos to perfect the project julia is heading, that he gets a glimmer of what really is going on inside of his wife's head.

with his usual finesse, mr. crichton does an admirable job of presenting a difficult subject in language that a layperson can appreciate--if not fully understand.  of all of his most recent offerings, 'prey' demands the reader's partial comprehension of the essence of nanotechnology to at least authenticate the book's premise.  jack speaks computer-ese easily, but if you are not at least familiar with older programming techniques you will find the differences that jack accentuates in his explanations regarding goal-oriented programming as opposed to parallel programming, downright unfamiliar territory.

otherwise, the plot follows the usual techno-suspense formula--the reader finds himself/herself turning pages at rapid fire speed as the characters combat a force that they created but no longer can control.  i found myself speed-reading to learn more about the science itself which crichton expertly weaves in with his action-packed storyline.  the actual denouement borders on the predictable---updating the frankenstein story with all its frightening repercussions---arrogant man infinging on a nature that he does not fully understand yet feels confident in altering.

convergence of hot technologies!  this is what crichton does best and i was pleased to see him returning to his sci-fi-thriller writing after reading the entertaining but rather pseudo-scientific timeline.
this time crichton deals primarily with nanotechnology.  what if humans were able to build tiny, dust-sized robots?  that could fly?  that were solar-powered?  that could reproduce?  that could evolve?  okay, so there are some leaps of faith, but the reading is nevertheless enjoyable, and crichton's easy, fluid writing always insures that the common man will never be lost in techno babble.
unfortunately, the interesting premise and engaging plot can only dissappoint.  there are countless typical crichton plot devices.  what if the technology gets out of control?  what if the one thing we need is outside in the shed??  what if we are presented with several generic characters who are probably movie-fodder for grisly deaths?
the last one hundred pages or so are pretty silly; the book begins to take a b-movie twist, switching from predictable to cliche.  also, the last three pages of the book consist almost entirely of tying up loose-ends and explaining plot holes.  it seems like sloppy writing, almost as if he got sick of writing the book and decided to quickly wrap it up.
crichton's characterization has come a long way since jurassic park.  his usual team of experts is not as clear cut and hand picked.  instead of the scientist, the lawyer, the businessman, and the mathmetician, we simply have a group of scientists with varying backgrounds.  and fortunately there are no annoying child geniuses who act like idiots.
all in all, crichton is a skilled storyteller and the book is a thrill to read.  i devoured it within barely 24 hours.  what makes the book even more amusing is the knowledge that crichton recently went through a painful divorce himself.  imo, it was pretty clear that the character julia was a stab at his ex, and the main character's voice was his own bitter cynicism following the ordeal.","interesting material, b-movie plot",1078358400,A2S6UCY7KY0QGS,Gambit293

  jack forman is currently a stay at home dad raising three children- the youngest being an infant. he fears his wife, who works long hours and behaves suspiciously, is having an affair. that is until he learns exactly what kind of work she is involved in. jack, a computer programmer by trade, led a group of programmers in developing a program that would create a biological process in the computer that could interact with and solve real world problems. there is an accident in the nevada desert and jack is called in on a temporary assignment to handle a group of nanoparticles that appear to be taking on a life of its own. the problem is the particles are programming themselves to hunt down and kill both animals and humans. they are, in effect, the predators and the humans are the prey.
  once again, michael crichton returns to the world in which science has gone awry in a terrible but somewhat plausible way. the strength of a crichton novel rests with the way he can move the action along while keeping the reader engrossed in the story. in the beginning we meet the main characters and set up the scientific basis for the upcoming disaster. we then proceed rather quickly into the action packed central aspect of the story. episodes get shorter and move quicker. the last sentence of each episode almost forces the reader to keep going-- phrases such as, ""i'm afraid we have big problems, jack."" or ""listening to her, i couldn't help but worry.""
  so it is a given that prey will hold the reader's attention throughout. i had a problem with the plausibility of the nanoparticles organizing into a cohesive and destructive swarm. their abilities appeared to be more and more outrageous as the story progressed. characters were stereotypes, yet, adequate for this type of a book. overall, well written and entertaining, but, lacking in any semblance of realism.",unrealistic but entertaining,1078185600,A3KNJ386MRBPZC,Larry

8145,3,"using facts of computer programming and multitudes of biological research, crichton has collaborated another page-turner on the futuristic insights of human progress.  with all of the supporting evidence, one might say that this scenario could actually occur.  already, scientists are cloning and there's nothing stopping them from making anything biologically dangerous out of genetic manipulation.
the idea of the book is that technology can be too much for us to handle.  though geniuses we are, we still make stupid mistakes.  in this case: man lives, man creates, and man gets into trouble - or really just one man gets to clean up the mess.
this one man turns out to be the typical three-kids-day-care dad who knows how to program codes.  he struggles with his personal life while trying to find a new job.
everyday, he encounters the same thing, kids in the bratty prattling stage, endless name calling and torment between sibling rivalries.  the children are portrayed so amusingly that they don't even seem to be real.  in fact, they are the ""hell"" that parents live though.
finally, we get to the big kick: the main-character's wife and his pal, jimmy, are the closest people imaginable to him.  he knows them like the back of his hand, but they are the ones who start the trouble.
questioning the rights of creation, this scenario is very unique, but like most playing god scenarios that crichton has written, this also turns out like an action movie ready to be filmed, like the old-timer's jurassic park.  unlike most prescript-novels, prey is a considerably complicated fact book in which the reader needs to truly understand and follow the fundamentals of bio-engineering.  the narration style is the key to the revelation of the plot.  and like i said: man lives, man creates, man gets into trouble, and man might come out alive.",prey,1076889600,A1UOXCPSW03GZ6,CSL

it offends me so much i'll likely never buy another crichton novel. my two teenaged sons (ages 17 and 13) have seen many of his movies, read his books, and not being overly offended in the past, i blindly purchased this paperback and let two sons, and my wife, read it first. then my wife comes to me and says, ""this is one great story about nanotechnology, but the language is absolutely ""terrible"".  belatedly, i then read the book and find she's right and embarrassed my sons have read it.
so: i enjoyed the story. a lot. i'd give it five stars if it omitted the most offensive profanity! whether you'll like this crichton novel a lot or be offended will in my opinion, be based on your sensitivity to profanity.

8152,3,"crichton shows us the dangers of nanotechnology in his latest novel.  in this case, a swarm of nanomachines escapes a military sponsored lab and go beserk as they evolve an even greater intelligence.  it's a really fun read, as crichton novels tend to be, but i can't give this book full marks.  as usual, crichton falls into his usual patern--a group of scientists or professionals, who by chance are also beautiful supermodels, face the current scientific hot topic, except it has gone terribly out of control.  in the process, half of the members die, and those who survive face an ambiguously happy ending which gives crichton the option to make a sequel.  this describes about 90% of crichton's novels, and it describes this one pretty well.
another weak point of this particular novel is that the solution to the problem is presented fairly early in the story, and you have to read through hundreds of pages and witness several pointless deaths before the hero figures it out.  usually crichton is good at giving you some twists at the end, but in this book, it plods straight ahead to the ending you expect.
in the end, i can't say this is a great book, but it is an entertaining book.  if you have enjoyed crichton's formulamatic books before, you'll probably enjoy reading this one.  if you got bored to death reading one of his other books, be warned, this is more of the same.","fun, but fluff",1074556800,A1V51M8M216Y69,T.

8153,3,"the terrors and pitfalls of nanotechnology are endless and far-reaching, and crichton uses this to good advantage.  the frequent explanations along the way, which some have said are dry and academic, to me added to the suspense, making the swarms of nanobots all the more frightening.  these nanobots are so real, in fact, that they threaten to overshadow the cardboard characters and formulaic plot (this science-run-amok template goes all the way back to frankenstein).  the characters are uninteresting and, in order for the plot to move along, they make some stupid mistakes so that the 'bots can get the upper hand (the main character, in fact, is so passive in the face of deception that he could just as well be sleep-walking).  then, at the end, the 'bots make some stupid mistakes for the plot to come to its conclusion.  read it for the science, not the story.

8154,3,"overall, prey was a good read.  i found the first half of the book slow, as i am not a computer programmer, nor do i want to be, but i know enough about computers that some of the stuff is exagerated.  i also did not care for the endless evolution theories, as even as crichton points out, 150 years in evolution proved us to be mostly wrong.  so why would modern theories be any better?  he just bases a large portion of his book on something i find very controversial and still unproven.
the second half of the book, when the swarms are finally introduced, is much better.  still plagued by evolution and distributred processing theories, but non-the-less gripping.  a bit predictable, the 'clues' about what will happen are very obvious.
i thought it was worth my time, as i am a huge crichton fan.  his other works, however, are much better in my opinion.  but the circumstances were very original!  whooda thunk - killer nano-bots!",good - but not the best,1073952000,A1LI3TJQ4AUXOY,Grizzit

his bot swarm development and activity make anything in ""jurassic park"" seem like the hardest of proven science by comparison, and it was far-fetched and belied a half-baked understanding of the biologically possible.
i was terminally disenthralled with this book and with crichton as a serious writer. my respect for his work has been badly shaken by his indulgence in fantasy to make this novel work. it was just too much!

M Simms
8158,2,"a hallmark of michael crichton's work over the years has been the issue of technology with unintended consequences thanks to human error. we are not as smart as we think we are, in short. from his first book, ""andromeda strain"" (which later became a movie of the same name) his literary vision has been of forefront technology coupled with human error bringing about unintended and often disastrous results. in ""andromeda strain,"" the spacecraft brings to earth space microbes that grow and kill. a concern that nasa took very seriously in the early days of the space program and now ignores as a virtual impossibility.
of course, there was ""jurassic park"" where some dinosaurs were brought to life in the present, which did not work out that well. ""timeline"" had its own technology issue where some of the characters didn't want to come back and were causing problems in the past. in his recent book, michael crichton picks bits and pieces of earlier novels as well as trendy topics such as being a stay at home dad and corporate malfeasance to whip up a novel that reads almost like a b movie. to say this is a shallow book, at least in regards to characters, gives the concept of ""shallow"" a bad name.
jack used to have it all. the super kids, the great cars, the nice house and a really cool job in silicon valley, california at mediatronics. he was having a blast supervising the team and helping to create ""distributed intelligence"" programs. (simplifying greatly, distributed intelligence programs as explained in the book are computer programs that mimic real world animal behavior to make computers work better and smarter. by acting like animals in a herd responding to stimuli, the computer program learns how to make the overall computer system work better.) however, jack slowly became aware of a gigantic corporate fraud being perpetrated on the shareholders and employees. in doing the right thing, he got himself fired and black balled by his former employers at the age of forty. for the last six months, he has been a stay at home dad while his wife julia has been working more and more hours.
she is a corporate big shot for xymos technology. the company is at the forefront of nanotechnology by using a different approach than normal. they are combining genetics with some elements of nanotechnolgy and distributed intelligence programs to create a different form of nanotechnolgy. the problem is that the company is desperate for venture capitalists and their financing and time is running out.
the strain at work is clearly taking a toll on julia. the strain of jack being out of work after six months in the silicon valley, which is a virtual death sentence in the world of cutting edge computers, is taking a tremendous toll on both of them. with resentment on these issues as well as a host of others, jack suddenly concludes julia is having an affair. not only is she dressing differently and subtly more beautiful despite the long hours she puts in at the office, her whole physical appearance seems to be changing. the way her body looks from head to toe seems to be subtly different and an improvement on her. her personality seems to be shifting as well.
but, his marital problems seem to slide onto the back burner when his old employers want him back temporarily on a consulting basis. it seems that xymos technology bought a computer program he designed called pred/prey and are having problems with their use of it. not only did julia never mention that they had bought it despite being in a position to know, jack can't figure out what use they would have for it or why it won't work. the program is designed as a model of predator and prey behavior reactions in the wild and while fairly accessible does not really work for what xymos is working on. but, he needs a job even if it is for a few days and with so many of his former team working for xymos and acting strange, he takes the job.
he is flown out to the fabrication lab for xymos out in the nevada desert. once there, he finds out things are far different than he was led to believe. there has been a massive release of nanoparticles from the laboratory. the initial swarm of nanoparticles has apparently given birth to succeeding generational swarms of nanoparticles. each generation is slowly becoming more complex and sophisticated as they evolve and using the pred/prey program, the swarms are learning. so far, the resulting swarms have proved unstoppable to this point and are deadly to animal and human alike. with each new generation of swarms, the fate of mankind becomes increasingly dim and soon they will be totally unstoppable.
while the basic story is entertaining, it is a typical end of the world disaster type book. the typical-- we made something, it got released into the environment, we screwed up, and guess what, we are really screwed because it will kill us all. the characters are very shallow even in the case of the main character jack. he seems two dimensional even in the places where he is supposed to be complicated and interesting and the initial marital setup section before the action gets going is way too long. the other characters who shift continuously in importance also seem to have a lack of depth and substance especially the computer programmers and others of his team.
they read like the often-wrong hollywood versions of techies in that these characters are extreme in personality, dress, and behavior.  some reviewers have criticized the author in that these characters frequently curse and therefore are offensive to the reader. while the cursing fits the characters as portrayed and did not really bother me, what i found offensive was the stereotypical portrayals of the characters as a whole. cut from cookie cutter molds, they seem to have as much substance as sugar cookies.
mixed into this morass are frequent long lecture sections on genetics and computer programs that were quite often completely over my head. for those so inclined, there is a multi page section at the back of the book involving a detailed reading list on the source material covering the topics fictionalized in the book. michael crichton is well known for doing his research and this clearly was no exception.
while the novel managed to hold my interest and was a fast read, too often it felt like i was reading a shallow novel interspersed with a college textbook. the work as a whole reads like the novelization of the latest hollywood disaster epic as well without the really neat special effects. considering the character complexity of many of his other books, ""prey"" in that regard was a disappointment. but, i am sure hollywood will love it.",the eating cloud: prey by michael crichton,1073260800,A2F6SZLKG0TOJ7,Kevin Tipple

frankly we've read this all before.  from crichotn and countless other suspense stories.  after reading the first 30 pages or so i got that awful feeling that i could tell exactly where the story was going, and dag gone it if i wasn't right.  crichton's writing is competant but it felt like his heart wasn't in the project.  there are two suspenseful moments in the story but they could have been more suspensful if we actually cared for the characters involved.  all in all it looks quite obvious that crichton writes hollywood screenplays more than a novels these days.
crichton's biggest mistake is relating much of the ending right at the beginning.  by having the main character tell the story to us as if it all happend a few months ago we're alerted to the fact that he's surrvived.  in a paragraph before the novel proper starts, we're even givin a brief glimpse of how the story winds up.  these techniques strip much of the suspense and intrigue from the story.

the story revolves around a nanotechnology project in the nevada desert.  a small research firm is working a department of defense contract to develop a battlefield intelligence-gathering system based on a cloud of nanocomponents.  these would act in concert, forming a composite lens and communications system that would have a high degree of survivability against conventional enemy countermeasures.  to complicate things, ""the nanoparticles in the cloud had to be endowed with a rudimentary intelligence, so that they could interface with each other to form a flock that wheeled in the air."" (pg. 125)  the flocking capability would enhance usefulness as well as survivability.  unfortunately emergence theory came into play during testing and development, which led to rapid evolution towards self-awareness and a survival instinct.
crichton does a reasonable job of explaining the technical basis underlying the plot.  he takes us through nanotechnology, artificial distributed intelligence, flocking behavior, and so forth.  this is what saves the book.  it's worth reading, but really only for the science in it.","okay, but not great",1073001600,A3M5AW697S0ETO,Emil L.

this story will undoubtedly be turned into a movie, there is an element of horror possible here and if the movie is done right, it could be pretty scary.  i recommend this to any that enjoy science fiction/fantasy type quick reading novels that haven't yet tried out the authors work.  if you already like his work, this book is not the mistake that the novel  jurassic park the lost world is and is not quite as fantastic as the novel timeline, if you have any interest in the world of nanotechnology it will be thought provoking at the least.",quick and fun read.,1072396800,A1VHK9A4VLJTHC,Michael Beverly
8168,2,"this would have been a nice idea for a short story but there wasn't enough rising action for a 500-page paperback novel.  the first 140 pages had good intrigue with the mysterious behavior of the protagonist's wife toward him and their family, but the middle part of the story was stretched way too thin.  it became a formula man-versus-monster sci-fi tale with the nano-particles playing the part of the monster created by the evil government defense contractor. the story picks up speed again in the last 100 pages as if crichton realized that he had enough filler for the 500 pages needed by the publisher and he could get on with completing the story.
crichton is good with biological and medical details and he's done his homework on cutting edge computer technology, but some of his technical explanations in the fields of electricity, magnetism and physics fall flat for the reader who truly understands these sciences. the literary quality of this novel is standard for modern fiction: one-dimensional characters who get angry and curse each other a lot in the most common type of profanity; this is how the author shows drama.  good drama and intrigue require more complicated character development.  if only michael had used that 360 pages in the middle for something more constructive.
michael crichton has paid his dues as a sci-fi writer.  he's written many novels, none of them very good except ""jurassic park"" which made him a star.  he can now rest on his laurels knowing that anything he grinds out will be a hit and will probably be turned into a screenplay.  if you like shallow sci-fi thrillers that you can speed-read any time and anywhere, you will be well-served by this book.",good idea for a short story,1072224000,AEFCBV52LF36H,Garry L.

-  the number one flaw in this book is that he makes his characters act so stupid.  they pick at each other with childish barbs and act like 5 year olds when they know they are exposed to death and destruction which can only be solved through teamwork.  i just don't know why creighton fills several of his books with this trait -- this book had the disease worse than i've ever seen in a creighton book.  creighton ought to go spend some time in the military so see how humans really act when in critical situations.
-  why was the main character called out to the site?  it never answers the question.  nobody wants his skills and yet this call is fundamental to the whole plot.
-  why can the swarm kill a rabbit quickly, yet some characters can be attacked big time and yet are fully recovered in a few hours?  i'm not being picky -- this is the basic issue that the plot revolves around.
-  why does every single person keep the production facility going even though chaos and destruction are reigning from the previously produced particles?
-  why are the characters smart enough to have created the particles, but so stupid they won't even try to see slightly into the future as to where the thing is heading.  this just ruined the believability that had been set up by good writing style.

the story in this case involves a company that has developed miniature robots for medical diagnostics.  necessary to their success is a program that allows them to act as a swarm (since any individual robot is too small to perform complex tasks); this swarm eventually gets loose from the supposedly secure facility and starts multiplying and preying on the local animals.  the narrator is called in to try and rein in the nanobots, but they are evolving faster than he can come up with ways to stop them.
crichton is an idea guy, and this story - like many of his novels - is dominated by the idea at the cost of other considerations such as plot or character.  in fact, most of the characters are little more than talking heads designed to represent various viewpoints (the voice of reason, the amoral entrepreneur, etc.) in the discussion of the dangers of this nanotechnology.  despite a string of best-selling novels, the number of memorable crichton characters can be counted easily on one hand, even if you lost a couple fingers in an accident.
this story is not completely original, revisiting elements from such books as jurassic park, the andromeda strain and sphere.  in the end, however, this is standard crichton:  fast reading and thought provoking without really being good writing.",standard crichton,1069372800,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,mrliteral
8183,3,"crichton's `prey' preys on our fears of crossing nano-technology, genetic engineering, bacteria and swarm-like predatory instinct to create a tautly focused techno thriller in the nevada desert.
the story concerns jack forman, an out of work but brilliant ai developer who is undergoing somewhat of a transitory period in his life as he adjusts to being a house husband whilst his wife, julia, who works for xymos technology, is growing increasingly estranged from him. as he struggles to maintain a normal family lifestyle whilst trying to see if her behavioural patterns fit those of a drug-induced problem or if she is having an affair (or both), he finds that the highly secretive work she is carrying out begins to intrude on their lives as their baby, amanda is taken ill with an undiagnosable condition, but then recovers immediately.
after julia has a car crash, jack finds himself being rehired by the company that previously sacked him and he flies out as a consultant to the xymos facility where he finds the nano-engineering has escaped into the desert and is beginning to exhibit an alarming rate of evolution and developing distinctive predatory swarm-like tendencies. all bit like a twenty-first century artificial version of the classic `swarm' scenarios.
throughout there is the reluctant corporate secrets and refusal to accept accountability, portrayed by the charming ricky, and a small team of brilliant technologists who inevitably start dying one by one from anaphylactic shock.
tie this in with a highly evolved techno-species that is both parasitic and symbiotic and you get a bigger mystery facing jack forman. by the end, jack has saved the unknowing world, but a great personal cost and crichton leave us with a chilling message in not thinking through the consequences of our technological advances.
the composition of this techno-thriller is not overly original, the small team, the isolated circumstances they cannot escape, an evolving predator, characters who are representative of bigger motives - all intended to create a claustrophobic effect. unfortunately, it does make it a little predictable so by the time the real reasons behind the mysteries are given, you've already figured it out. nonetheless, it does it in a way that is unputdownable. as with all crichton novels this could easily be converted to the small screen and whilst it is no jurassic park, would prove sufficiently entertaining.",no jurassic park,1069372800,A1DGJOJ1D49YZ8,ilmk

no spoilers here, but think of this book as jurassic park on the microscopic level. the main group of characters is trapped in a secluded area. if caught, they'll be killed by the predator. how can they get away? does this entire plot sound familiar?
crichton appears to be writing a screenplay in book form in order to re-capitalize on the jurassic park popularity of former years. sure it is fun and entertaining, but i was hoping for something a little more original.","jurassic park on a microscopic level, not worth all the buzz",1069027200,A3F1IGAS4XLD81,Jerry L.

8187,2,"jack forman is a stay at home dad after being fired as a computer analyst for a respected company in silicon valley.  his life begins to fall apart shortly after this: he suspects his wife, julia, is having an affair (she comes home each night and showers before doing anything else), he can't find a local job to save his life, and now one of his three kids (the baby) is sick!  she screams and screams and screams inconsolably until she's put in an mri machine at a local hospital.  what happened there?
what happened is that nano-machines (tiny machines designed by man for tasking...whether it be medical or, let's say, military applications) were on jack's daughter's body.  they were accidentally brought home by julia.  jack soon learns that julia is working for a company called xymos, a nano-tech, bio-tech firm with a secret base in the nevada desert.  they've been developing nano-machines for the military to help with spying.  but something has gone amiss and jack is summoned to help them figure it out.  it seems that a program that jack wrote called pred-prey was instilled into the nano-machines and now they're gaining some form of consciousness, killing things after being 'accidentally' set loose onto the nevada desert.  now someone is in deep do-do!
i don't mind techno-babble stories as long as they have strong characters.  but this story dragged due to the overly-descriptive passages on nano-technology and the development of it as an antagonist.
i read timeline last year and wasn't very impressed by that novel either (simply because it read like a screenplay...and, what do you know!  they're making a movie out of it!  you can read my review of that story here at amazon, too.).  my advice to mr. crichton would be to not worry about trying to keep up with the techno-world so that you can develop ""fresh new ideas.""  come up with fresh characters and put them in some hairy situations.  we'll follow you!  i promise.

8190,3,"prey is a good read. it's fast, it's entertaining, it's even educational a little. i enjoyed reading it. it is a sold crichton book, and a good beach or plane read.
the thing is ... it's not original enough to earn more than 3 stars. crichton, while not being a great novelist (let's face it, his characters are not very well developed, they are just there, so the plot can move), nearly allways in the past was original. before crichton we haven't read about deadly viruses, nearly sentient gorillas (not counting ""planet of the apes"" or several comic-book characters), or dinosaurs in the modern world.
but deadly nanomachines ... well, we even had mulder and scully dealing with the problem in one of original x-files novels (""antibodies""). the fact that the nanotechnology is not a novel idea in books is not, of course, the authors fault, but it makes the scientific aspect of the novel (which allways was one of crichtons strong points) less interesting.
also, i found the first part of the novel a bit too long. this is the part of the novel, which shows the life of the mysterious occurances, and the main character wondering about what's going on, etc. it is well written. but let's face it - you've read the back cover, so you allready know the reason behind all this.
that's the problem with many of todays novels, or maybe not novels, but books. having to sell them, the publishers put too much information on the cover, and sometimes it spoils the experience of reading. i think that when it comes to crichton or king, the publishers can wet our interest not by giving away plot points, but by surrounding the book in mystery - like the 5th harry potter book. if i've approached this book without any information about what i'll find inside, i would've definetly enjoyed it more.",what you can't see can kill you,1067472000,A2BREDS7ID368P,Alexander Gitlits

no, i wasn't expecting shakespeare, and yes, crichton does bring up some interesting ideas about the dangers of nanotechnology and biotechnology.  (not worthy of a three-page bibliography, usually reserved for scholarly works, but interesting nevertheless.)  still, this book seemed rather less imaginative than anything by philip k. dick, and i found myself not particularly caring about whether the wife would live, or whether the kids were ok, or the end of the world, or anything like that.  the characters were two-dimensional, hurried, barely even sketched.
great idea, haphazard execution.  perhaps mr. crichton's editors are too much in awe of the author-as-moneymaker to offer him constructive advice on the basics of creative writing, but i'm sure there are good community college programs toward that end if he's interested.",like cheese curls,1065571200,AH3P7WBD18OZG,J.

the use of first person was a bad idea. for example, when the narrator is in danger, you know he has to live. because there would be no book without the narrator, he has to survive.  that really cuts down on the suspense.
one thing that really annoyed me about prey was the continuous way of explaining things that ordinary people not involved in biology/nanotechnology/genetic fields wouldn't know.  first, jack (the narrator and pseudo-hero) has a little chat and speaks in indecipherable language for about a page and half.  then another page and a half explains what the heck the two characters were talking about.  and so it continues: dialogue-explain, dialouge-explain, etc.
the plot itself has huge holes and is very stephen king-esque.  a mystery/horror/this-is-going-to-happen-someday-and-your-job-is-to-prevent-is prevalent throughout the novel.

my feedback:
1) setting - silicon valley is where things originate. believable and functional for this story. nevada is another local and it too is necessary and logical. the setting is something most of us can envision and/or relate to.
2) characters - our main protagonist is the image of many men in america today = unemployed by the high-tech field, finding dead ends to job leads and trying to help out in the household between job searches. this character and the rest are easily believable and give us enough sympathy for thier plight that there is a connection. actions are logical and in character.
3) plot - this is where the story lags in my opinion...the reason i don't read tom clancy is due to the pages and pages of technical explaination that go into his writing. this book suffers from the same plague of too much exposition. the ""conflict""/antagonist isn't very easily explained like in the jurassic park books so more pages are needed in order to give the reader a surface understanding of what is going on with the out of control technology. based on other reviews it appears this is the biggest turn-off for most readers, myself included.
the rest of the story is ok regardless of any formularic plotting involved. the level of suspense is not near that of t-rex or raptor for me even though the reality of nano-virus should be more fearsome. it is almost analogous to give me a live terrorist or show me a facility that manufactures bio-weaponry. the ""physical"" threat seems more urgent in such cases in my opinion, regardless of how naive or misguided that might be.
4) audiobook reading - the reader of the book does a fair job. descent acting throughout. he does not make use of acting in different voices in order to dramatize the reading more, but it wasn't necessary.
overall - go and read timeline by critchon...it is a much better book. you don't have to waste your time, but any true fan of this author will still probably want to read it just to say they've read everything by him. good luck.",review of auidobook version,1061251200,A2F1P10GGZ7K2T,Super2018

8220,1,"by this stage anyone who picks up a crichton novel should be well prepared for the formula: new technology full of hope & promise, unprincipled scientists/techno-freaks out to make a buck regardless of risk, ponderous hero who always intuits that ""something isn't quite right here"", technology runs amok, scary chase scene, hero wins out in spite of all odds, cautionary message bashing science & technology in wrap-up. i don't mind formulas when i am looking for an escapist novel & in the past crichton has managed to throw in enough character development & believable science to keep me reading. alas, prey seems to have been written on the back of an airline safety card while stuck in a holding pattern over san jose.  the characters are tissue thin, the dialog is unbelievable, and even the monster (a cloud of self-programming nano-particles that are supposed to be the pentagon's next super spy camera but of course have ideas of their own) fails to grab our attention. i suppose that i should be grateful that we are spared much of the pseudo-philosophizing & gratuitous chaos-theory invocations that kept creeping into crichton's 90's novels (we do get gratuitous fractals in prey, but they are blessedly less obvious) but he still hates science & scientists & perhaps it is time to look for other villains? the pity is that nano-technology and self-organizing computer networks are indeed exciting & potentially scary new frontiers in technology & i feel that crichton could have made an excellent novel around them (witness for instance his still provocative book on psycho-surgery: terminal man, which even a quarter of a century later makes one pause & ponder. here he simply doesn't have his mind on the job & resorts to what amount to b-horror movie cliches in place of real character or situation development. ugh.",a nano-novel,1056326400,A2UFNPMCFLC7PX,John Anderson
8221,4,"michael crichton's latest work comes in a most unexpected way.  i found prey to be a refreshing change from the usual sci-fi novel fare.
the book revolves around a man named jack forman, an unemployed but brilliant computer programmer who had created a 'predator-prey' software program.  after a series of bizarre incidents, jack is mysteriously called back by his former employers to go to a lab in the nevada desert.  once there, jack realizes the horrifying truth: his 'pred-prey' program has been used to create a new type of nano-technology that would be used by the government as a high-tech surveillance device.  but something has gone horribly wrong.  a large swarm of the nano-machines has escaped into the nevada desert, and it is evolving at an alarming rate.  not only is it learning to adapt, but it is also preying on living things to sustain itself.  the swarm must be destroyed, but doing so may prove more difficult than anyone had ever imagined.
now you may be asking yourself ""so what's so scary about a cloud of microscopic machine particles?""  well, leave it to crichton to make something like that scary!  the vague summarization i gave doesn't do the book justice.  its more of a brief synopsis to pique your interest.  the book actually consists of 3 parts.  the entire first part of the book revolves around jack's life as an at-home dad.  huge problems are devoloping with his wife julia, who he suspects is having an affair, and his inability to land a job is getting to him.  this entire section of the book is great because of the sheer amount of character development.  many complain about this part of the book moving too slowly, but i found it to be quite interesting.  in fact, i wouldn't have cared as much about the character of jack forman had this section not been so thorough.  one reviewer throws a hissy fit over the interaction between jack and his kids: a young teenage girl, a pre-pubescent punk little boy, and a baby daughter.  i must say i found nothing wrong with the dialog between them.  anyone with kids could tell you that the dialog pretty much sums up your typical teenager and punk little kid with complete accuracy.  the character development alone is one of the book's best qualities.
after the first portion of the book, we are transported to the lab in the nevada desert, where the action takes place.  i admit that when i first read the blurb about this book i was skeptical.  i approached it with limited interest, but once i started reading it i was intrigued.  by the second part of the book, crichton hits you with so much technical and scientific information that its almost too much to take in.  but if you read through it and allow your brain to absorb it, the explanations become clear.  the concept of why the nano-swarm attacks and 'devours' its prey is explained...and even if you don't catch it, its not difficult to grasp.  once you realize what the base structure of the nano-machines are, it becomes obvious why they must attack and devour.
even so, there are details that are left out which would tend to confuse the reader.  also, i found myself somewhat disinterested in a few of the side characters.  crichton introduces them briefly but never goes into much detail about them, which results in a rather unconcerned attitude towards those characters.  otherwise, the characters that have an impact develop over the rest of the book rather well.
the action in the book is pretty well done.  i felt a sense of urgency for jack, and there were some parts during the book that made me cringe.  other parts were exciting, others were nerve-racking, and most were just plain tense.  it was tough to put the book down, and when i got to the final third of the book i found myself reading non-stop until the end.
one of the most remarkable and impressive aspects of the book has got to be the bibliography.  when you see how much painstaking research went into the book, you'll realize that all that technical mumbo-jumbo that crichton spewed out on so many of those pages is actually relevant, and you'll appreciate the work that went into it and be able to take in all the knowledge.  it almost seems too incredible and ubeleivable to be real, but most of the information that crichton put into the book was entirely accurate, which takes the book up a notch (and makes the future of technology seem not quite as safe anymore...).
i thoroughly enjoyed this book.  its never gets so technical that you just want to put it down, and it never really drags either.  its definitely not another jurassic park, but its a worthy read nonetheless.  if you're looking for a book that will entertain and thrill you, then pick up prey.  its not going to be the next great american novel, and if you're expecting an utter masterpiece then you will be disappointed.  i see alot of criticism for this book that is just completely asinine.  either people need to lay off the no-doze or they just need to be able to keep an open mind and accept this book for what it is: a well-researched, science fiction/science fact adventure that will keep you reading til the end.  i won't go as far as saying that this is one of the best books i've ever read, but when i was finished with it, it just felt good to read an intriguing and entertaining book.","an entertaining, intriguing book",1056067200,A2JU4FUSW1PBEC,Michael P.

8226,1,"michael crichton has a great formula for people to continue purchasing his books - it's a gamble that you will either be thoroughly entertained and enrapt in the story or thoroughly disappointed.  i'd put prey in the latter category.
jack is an unemployed computer programmer who's wife julia is wholly consumed in her work on bio-and nano-technology at xymos.  but julia becomes more and more distant, a changed person - no longer the loving wife and mother.  thus, the first 1/3 of the book deals with jack as mr. mom, while trying to figure out if julia's having an affair, as well as how he can get a job in a field in which 6 months of unemployment is a career-ending situation.  i felt as if i were watching a mid-afternoon soap opera.
then xymos contacts jack for help.  it seems the computer program xymos is using for its nano-technology ventures was originally started by jack and his team and now the program has some ""bugs"" in it that needs his expertise.  meanwhile, julia's been in a car accident, jack's sister is pushing him to get a divorce, his kids continually fight, oh the horror!
the sad thing is...this is when the book turns south.  the events and people that jack encounters at xymos are confusingly put together, very disjointed, and does not allow the reader to grasp  just where crichton wants to take us.  the ""prey"" itself was confusing, its progression disjointed, its ultimate reason for killing not evident, its purpose left in the crichton's mind only.
i was not entertained, i was not horrified, i was not moved at all.  this was a very easy book to put down each day.  i finished it because i have finished every book i have ever started (as well as it being recommended by some friends).  but beyond those friends remaining my friends, this venture with crichton was not worth the time taken to write this review.",i preyed that it would end,1054339200,A34ADVKDAVPNMS,Mark Wagenschutz
8227,1,"how do i hate ""prey:a novel""?----let me count the ways.
1) michael crichton's tale of nanotechnology is crammed full of filler and fluff; indeed, the first 1/3 of the book (sadly the best part) has nothing to do with nanotechnology, and everything to do with our protagonist jack's life of house-husbandry and slowly (ever so....slowly) crumbling marriage. even the *title* of the book is fluffy, for pity's sake: ""prey: a novel""???? a novel? as distinguished from what, ""prey: a coloring book""?
2) fluff, if it's well-written, can be good, if it is used in the service of a higher goal and the novel pays off. sadly, the novel does not. in a nutshell, the plot: jack, unemployed computer programmer and devoted house-husband of julia, worries (for 1/3 of the book) about his fraying marriage, and julia's increasing distraction and strange behavior.
you see, julia, a senior executive of biotech start-up xymos, is evincing the signs of a woman having an affair. she's distracted, she's cranky, she's irritable, she's distant, she works late and takes a shower when she gets home---and she's starting to really shape up! after his wife's car accident, jack finds out the lovely julia has been spending entire days at xymo's microchip fabrication plant, and gets hired as a consultant to figure out what's going on.
what's going on? the gentle reader can probably figure it out. xymos, you see, is making little biomechanical machines on a nano (extremely small) scale, and the little devils have gotten out of control. when jack gets to the lab, the little devils (actually nano-sized military cameras for battlefield surveillance) are outside the lab---but for how long? worse, because nanotechnology replicates, they're breeding---a little swarm of nano-cameras buzzing all over the desert, and they're not out to have you say 'cheese.'
3) if i've made ""prey: a novel"" sound more exciting than it is, and i have, then i'm sorry. we've seen all of this before in jurassic park, except that book was fresh and interesting. this is just a boring rehash, a book that dissolves into a frantic chase when our hero gets to the lab and finds the little velociraptors (i'm sorry, nanomachines) devouring anyone they can find. go ahead and slog through the first 1/3rd of the book hoping for a payoff---you'll regret it.
4) nanotechnology is an exciting concept that many companies have already employed; doubtless we'll see more extensive and imaginative applications of it in our lifetime. but crichton has taken this marvellous concept (with its ominous implications, as both k. eric drexler and greg bear have suggested) and turned it into a monster-of-the-week novel---and a long, tedious, boring read, at that.
if you want to see what the nanotechnology-gone-horribly-wrong theme looks like in the hands of a master, then grab the appalling and unsettling ""blood music"", by greg bear. in the meantime, save your money and your time and avoid ""prey"".","been there, done that---with dinosaurs. a snooze-a-thon.",1053993600,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,Dark Mechanicus JSG
8228,3,"this was the first novel i read by crichton and overall it was pretty good.  the concept of nanotechnology is very interesting.  i have also read by light of the moon by dean koontz which dealt with nanotechnology but in a different way.  the major complaint i had was with the whole focus on the narrator's family life.  although it played a role in the plot, i felt it went too deep into it and took away from the story.  also, the i didn't like the way the author portrayed the kids.  the kid's behavior didn't seem real life, the name calling was something an adult might imagine children saying to each but in reality don't.  and after awhile it just got annoying reading about them.  i gave it three stars because of the idea and also the second half of the novel was better than the first half.","good idea, lacking substance",1053561600,A3O75PJL7R0Q4U,Kent
8229,3,"there is an important message to the reader in prey - to be aware, and beware, of boundless technological progress.  the enemy in prey is not the nanotechnology that has gotten out of hand and started killing humans in the nevada desert, but the humans who created it.  sound familar?  right - we already read jurassic park, and of course it's easier to fear dinosaurs than particles.  crichton has always given readers plenty of pure fact and science in his fiction novels, but in prey, at times, crichton blinds the reader at time with scientific information more appropriate in a phd dissertation than an action/sci-fi novel.  usually when you finish a crichton novel, you have learned a lot (and been entertained) without realizing how much you had learned.  congo and rising sun are good examples - total page turners with plenty of suspense, but a lot of underlying fact.  when prey gets rolling in the main story - panicked scientists trying to control swarms of nanoparticles that are evolving and becoming more intelligent with each passing hour - crichton bombs the reader with pages of hardcore scientific fact and theory that, for many, may defy comprehension.  so it is difficult to feel the urgency and suspense over the plot line when you can't quite interpret the underlying point.  my favorite part of the book was the first half - before there was much science to it - when crichton sets the table with the unemployed house-husband narrator observing his wife's strange behavior (suggestive of an affair) and his children's mysterious illnesses and broken appliances - all to be explained later.  crichton writes so well about relationships and misery in them (as featured in disclosure as a couple deals with infidelity) to the point that the reader really sympathizes with the narrator well before he gets caught up in the scientific hysteria.  as for the action sequences, we follow the narrator and a team of scientists as they chase after, and are then chased by, these nanoswarms.  some of the confrontations seems almost like schlock-sci-fi (with one mechanism stolen right from the green mile) and i cannot see this book becoming a movie.  i enjoyed timeline and airframe much more than this book, yet i know crichton feels the message in prey is much more important for all of us to grasp.  if only he had packaged it in his usual manner, maybe more readers would be able to grasp it.  despite my mostly negative review, this is a crichton book, which, at its worst, is still heads above most fiction.  enjoy!",not crichton's best... but compelling at times...,1053129600,A1TLZMW0Q3KHF6,Calvin93

8236,2,"crichton's ""prey"" explores the possibilities and the potential catastrophies that might occur with nanotechnology. one reading a chrichton novel expects a consistent dose of science, yet despite the interesting theme of this novel, the first 130 pages or so of the novel is devoted entirely to the main character's family problems. i am amazed that i continued reading about such boring and ultimately inconsequential situations.
although crichton's characters in ""prey"" are more ""real"" and human than chrichton's characters usually are, the dialogue is ridiculous. the main characters children speak to each other (and their parents) like brats. the adults rarely sound much better.
the novel has many positive points and the middle portions of the novel are interesting and the pages turn quickly. the ending is poorly written and did not satisfy me. although chrichton attempts to tie the ending to the beginning, this technique, while usually effective, did not work well here.
without a doubt, crichton is a brilliant mind and a great writer, but ""prey"" needed a team of editors. he certainly could have done better.",interesting but very flawed,1051315200,A34KZYE51A0A19,MJN76
8241,2,"i was extemely impressed with michael chriton when i read this novel.  not at the quality of the writing, the plot, or the science though; rather i was impressed that he could make nanobots act just like dinosaurs.
the writing is still just as gripping as in his other books, and the inconsistencies in the plot aren't too obvious, but none of the characters are really well developed, and they often act in ways that add drama to the story, rather than as a consiquece of their personalities or logic.
the science is perhaps the worst thing about the book.  in jurassic park the only strange thing seemed to be chriton's belief that zoos couldn't possbily work.  in prey, though, we see numerous examples of confusion about the sizes of things, over and misuse of buzzwords, and downright magical evolution.  the creatures in prey seem to evolve new abilities in just one or two generations, evolve without selective pressure, and evolve as a group rather than as individuals-all without exchanging genes.
if you want something fun to read, adn don't have too much background in science, this book could be quite fun.  just don't believe the science.",i suppose it could have been worse,1050969600,A2SR33L0CMNDGL,Andrew Clough
8243,3,"while not his best novel, crichton does a competent job of weaving a tale of suspense around some interesting emerging technologies.  the first part of the novel had me hooked, but by the time he shifts locations, crichton started to lose me.  there are a couple of reasons for this.
first, there is the mystery around what is happening to his wife.  i found this pretty transparent, and so found myself having to wait far too long for it to be revealed.  second - and this is my own fault - i found the capabilities of the technology in the story pretty tough to swallow.  i work in software, and have used some of the techniques discussed, so it was hard for me to suspend my disbelief sufficiently.
still, i thought the idea behind the story was interesting, and the beginning and end of the novel were pretty engaging.  if you don't mind a little technology mixed in with your fiction, you might like this.  i wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but i wouldn't try to dissuade you from reading it, either.",interesting subject matter,1050019200,A1HIGUOO5L504V,Yet Another Amazon Customer
8245,1,"my opinion of michael crichton has sunk to a new low. this book reads like a sloppy first draft from someone who decided it was time to cash in on the current public and media interest in nanotechnology.
from a literary perspective, why would anyone care about the two-dimensional characters in this book, much less the gauzy excuse for a plot and sleep-inducing ending?
if viewed purely from a ""hard science"" angle, the book also fails miserably because the author couldn't be bothered to provide even a half-way plausible explanation for his nanotech swarms. anyone with background in the physical or computer sciences will find the underpinnings for this latest variation on shelley's frankenstein laughable.
good books from acknowledged masters of the genre feature one or more interesting ideas, are populated with fully formed, three-dimensional characters and plot elements, and furnish the reader with believable extensions to known scientific fact. this book, however, is drivel and i'm sorry i wasted money buying the hardcover edition. i expected much better from the author of the andromeda strain, and it will certainly be a long time before i take a chance on another crichton book.",a waste of money,1049760000,A206I9KX1I3GYK,L. F. Zea
8254,2,"in prey, michael crichton does it again: merges action with techno-zeitgeist by bringing nanotechnology into his familiar world of brainy, regular-joe heroes; a supporting cast of death-ready, 2-dimensional characters; and bad guys so obvious they might as well be twirling snidely whiplash moustaches as they violate the boundaries of nature.
it's my firm conviction that, by now, crichton-- a very smart, very tall man, with lots of connections and money-- has created his very own, personalized novel writing machine full of evolutionary algorithms and whatnot such that, when he gets an idea (and he almost always has a+ ideas) he can shoot an outline and a few key concepts into his nwm and set it to cook for, oh, a week.  in the meantime, he sells the movie rights and adjusts characters according to producers' casting concerns.
which is my smart... way of saying this book, like many of his others, has a great ""hook"" to use a music industry term and one that continues to rook me in, despite the knowledge that i will be forced to read as one stock character after another (or, in prey, the main character) describes in giant blocks of exposition how it is the science works.  and, you know, all these tiny robots are cool but i could read engines of creation by eric drexler and care more about the characters... and it's non-fiction.
i would recommend prey only to those who know what they're getting into, and to speed-readers with a long airplane ride ahead of them.  or to those with the constitution to become emotionally involved in soap opera plots and people.",crichton drives me nuts!,1049760000,A33HF1H525AEYS,Aaron Neptune
8255,3,"""prey"" is michael crichton's latest techno-thriller with the emphasis on the technology at the expense of the thrills.  granted, i am somebody who never took biology let along chemistry or physics in high school so my ability to assimilate scientific information gets maxed out at the level of ""jurassic park.""  i understand the ""what ifs"" of finding dinosaur dna and filling the gaps with sequences from frogs.  but crichton quickly leaves me in the dust in this novel.
after an introduction entitled ""artifical evolution in the twenty-first century,"" which made me nervous that there might be some sort of quiz at the back of the book, we are given a glimpse at the end of the story before going back to the beginning: ""day 1, 10:04 a.m.""  our hero is jack forman, currently an unintentional househusband but once the overseer of computer programmers attempting to solve problems by mimicking the behavior of predatory animals.  jack is staying home taking care of the three kids while his wife, julia, is working lots of long hours at the top secret research labs of xymos technology.  jack is getting suspicious about her behavior (the first thing she does when she gets home is take a shower), but that seems the least of his problems when the baby starts screaming.  amanda's entire body has turned a bright, angry red despite no sign of fever or infection.  the doctors are totally confounded and amanda does not stop screaming until she is given an mri, at which point she returns to normal.
this is a book where pretty much everything is connected, but knowing that you are seeing clue after clue paraded before your eyes is not going to do you much help in figuring out the mystery that confronts jack.  crichton is telling the story in a first person voice and jack constantly has to interrupt the narrative to explain the science involved in a particular plot point.  julia's company is doing something with self-replicating nano-technology, but whatever they are doing is getting way out of hand.  jack is called in as a consultant at factory in the nevada desert to do some trouble-shooting, but quickly learns that nobody is telling him the complete truth or giving him the big picture on what is happening.
the more you know about science in general and nano-technology in particular (aside from the relevant episdoes of ""star trek: the next generation"") the more you are going to enjoy ""prey"" for the simple reason that you will be able to understand what is going on a whole lot better than the rest of us.  my gut instinct is that there is a point where the evolutionary growth of the little monsters becomes far-fetched, but i have little chance of knowing that for sure, let along of convincing anybody else.  ""prey"" was a book that i did not want to put down simply because i was going to have a hard time remembering all the technological aspects about what was going on when i picked the novel back up.  i pity the writer who has to turn ""prey"" into a film script because unless they figure out how to provide footnotes during the film audiences are going to have trouble understanding what is happening on a scientific level.",a techno-thriller overburdened by having way too much techno,1049155200,A2NJO6YE954DBH,Lawrance Bernabo
8257,3,"michael crichton likes to list non-fiction books that he used as source material for his novels.  there is a lengthy list at the end of prey, but he left a large category of literature out: his own back catalogue.  prey so heavily recycles crichton's past premises, scenarios, character types, and clichs that had anybody else written it, that person would have been charged with plagiarism.  the cardboard characters, always two or three steps behind the reader, are more nauseating than the intentionally gooey parts of the book, especially early on when crichton is establishing their innocence and normalcy.  yet despite these flaws, nobody writes more suspenseful science fiction than michael crichton.  along with all the cliches, crichton manages to recycle the fast pace and genuine suspensfulness of some of his better, earlier books.
beyond copying himself, crichton's original inspiration has always been frankenstein.  prey, like so many of his books, is about humans pushing a hot, exotic science too far.  instead of dinosaurs or should-have-been-left-alone warrior apes in the jungle, this time the monster is a swarm of omnipotent micro-cyborgs (actually, many such swarms).  all the old elements are there - the conniving female lead who is eventually consumed by the consequences of her own greed, the subtly political male (this time crichton manages to inject a paragraph about father's rights) protagonist, the company that puts profits ahead of safety, and the team of scientists who get picked off one by one.
how many times can these ingredients make a good soup?  i don't know, but the stew hasn't lost its flavor yet.  since it is impossible to read this book in more than a week, there's no major commitment in taking it on, so i felt what i got what was worth what i put into it.","nothing original, but the formula still works",1049155200,A2PBKFCD7YI23H,John B.

8260,3,"great concept, excellent research on behalf of the author and altogether very well put together.  however when writing sci-fi you don't have to assume your audience is stupid and will ""buy"" anything and everything you throw at them... and i am not talking about artificial intelligence or animal behavior algorithms, i am talking about common sense.  i felt like screaming ""wake up and smell the coffee"" to the main character about 100 time through the course of the book... why he kept getting into so many predicaments that no one ""logically"" would, i don't know.  fiction is not supposed to be totally unrealistic as much as it should be imaginative.  there is a fine line between absurdity and a great story line and crichton crossed that line many times in his book.
the first part of this novel was great! great setup, outstanding at creating all the necessary suspense... a definite page turner.  the second half just plummets! a one ton brick... over the top, at times stupid and resorting to ""maybe"" whatever was on tv when he was writing that chapter.
in the end, i enjoyed the book, if anything i should say it was a very quick read.  the story doesn't overwhelm you and there is not much breath of characters, which keeps it simple. the worst part was that i was really looking forward to reading this book and in being completely honest with myself i have to say it let me down... maybe it won't let you down
i can't not recommend this book because it does carry along a certain entertaining value and if nothing else it will be an eye opener to the ""reality"" of what is possible with the technology as we think we know it today... scary... yes, very scary and as an it professional myself i have to say that it is not that far fetched!

8275,3,"in prey, crichton uses primarily the same formula that he did in jurassic park and timeline.  replace dinosaurs and medieval horrors with nanoparticles, and you have prey.  that is not such a bad thing.  all three of these novels will keep you up late at night trying to get to the resolution of some very exciting sequences.

the resolution in prey does seem a little flat though.  the climax of prey is filled with as much intensity as any of his novels, but the denouement (falling action after the climax) is weak at best.  when you hit the last page, you find yourself wondering why he would end the story at that moment. there is still a little left to be resolved.

i was also a little put off by the main character.  we are supposed to see him as being intellectual and yet some very obvious details and clues slip right past him.  at times he is passive to the point of absurdity and other times he is a determined leader.  crichton's characters tend to be a little flat.  he is usually more concerned with providing background details than he is with developing characters.

having said this, prey is a fun read.  crichton's stories hold your attention, and like his books from the past, this one keeps you reading.",a fun read but not his best,1046304000,A18HWDYD7HXGCS,Bruce Tracy
8278,2,"this book comes very highly recommended, and i will concede that the author's descriptions of the alaskan wilderness are vivid and moving, and his knowledge seems quite extensive. but i found the story itself rather dull, his writing style other than his descriptions being competent but unmoving, and i found no sense of connection with either the author or with his friend, michio, which it seems to me was the entire point of the story: to create a sense in the reader of connection to the two men and a feeling for their friendship.

in fact, i felt so little connection to michio that in the chapter describing his death, rather than feeling saddened or upset at his death, i couldn't help but think what an idiot he had been, that he'd gotten what was coming to him and that he deserved a mention in the next ""darwin awards"" book. after all, here is a man who had been a wildlife photographer for years; he's in an area that has bears in it, one of which has been demonstrating an aggressive curiosity for several days. the bears are hungry, as their food source (salmon) are late arriving. there is a cabin available; everyone else sleeps either in the cabin or on the roof of the cabin, yet michio doesn't like sleeping indoors when the opportunity for sleeping under the open stars presents itself, so he sleeps in a tent. and the author relates all of this, but seems oblivious to the fact that his friend brought his own death on himself by deliberate, stupid carelessness. i am, honestly, more saddened by the fact that the bear was hunted down and killed afterward since it was now a ""known killer"" than i am by the fact that a man who should have known better didn't have the sense to come in out of the rain. he was only slightly less stupid than people who try to pose their kids with bears, or offer them food and try to pet them, and as a professional wildlife photog, he had no excuse for being so stupid.

given that this is decidedly not the impression that i believe that the author was attempting to convey, i have to say that the book failed in one of its key aims. given that it is competently written and edited, and that it does have more than its share of vivid descriptions of the beauty of the alaskan wilderness, as well as some interesting history of the area, i certainly can't rate it at just one star; i will confess that it is much closer to three stars than to one. but i can't bring myself to rate it as highly as mediocre.","disappointing, given how many people have raved to me about it.",1247356800,A3FHAMLNGHCFU7,James Yanni

also, i'm not a big fan of illogical coincidences that play a crucial role in the plot. like jack having written the code that his wife's company was using, it was a little too convenient. i think the story would have worked much better if that had been presented differently.

""prey"" certainly falls into this category.
unemployed computer scientist jack forman is struggling with being a stay-home dad while his wife works obsessively on a new project. her mysterious project happens to involve work he has been involved with in the past. his wife is gone for days at a time and jack suspects she's having an affair. he is soon brought in to the project when things spiral out of control. what jack discovers at a remote laboratory in the desert is a swarm of micro computers, accidently released into the environment acting as a killing swarm. needless-to-say, he has his work cut out for him in trying to destroy this rapidly growing menace.
i enjoyed the idea of this new type of monster created by crichton, and several of the situations when dealing with this insect-like swarm were inventive and suspenseful. the set-up, taking place at a lab in the desert, is perhaps a bit too reminiscent of one of crichton's early novels ""the andromeda strain,"" and the swarms replicating and eventually forming into people was a bit too ""invasion of the body snatchers"" for my taste. the novel soon closes with movie-type situations in which men and women are running for their lives, climbing ladders and fighting desperately along precarious catwalks.
which is why i don't think ""prey"" is an especially great science fiction novel. like ""sphere,"" like ""congo"" and like ""timeline,"" the set-up is fascinating, but then it regresses into predicatable plot devices and chase sequences. the colorful hodgepodge of scientists at the lab are fairly textbook, and one can practically predict who's dog meat and who will survive. thus, the suspense is never very intense nor inspired. been there, done that.

jack forman a bright fortyish unemployed computer software designer with a biology background is acting as a house husband to his three children.  his wife julia, who also has a computer background, is a v.p. of xymos.  xymos is a company involved in nanotechnology whose major project is being funded by the department of defense.  they are developing a super miniature undetectable surveillance camera which can be suspended in the air much like dust, in a remote facility in the nevada desert.
xymos has been having developmental problems and the d.o.d is threatening to stop the flow of money.  in addition julia forman has been acting very bizzarely and neglecting her family.
a desperate phone called is placed to jack forman by xymos to help them correct their problems as a paid consultant.  he is flown out to the nevada laboratory where he learns that a swarm of these mini cameras has escaped the facility.  they have been created using both biological and computer technology originally created by forman.  shockingly, the swarm is reproducing and evolving at a rapid pace and showing characteristics of living entities.  this evolution is being nurtured by the killing and consumption of the local animal population with the xymos technicians as their apparent next targets.

jack forman is an out of work software specialist functioning, for the first third of the book, as a modern day silicon valley mr. mom.  his wife, julia, however, is at the forefront of xymos technology, and is working on a nanotechnology project for the military at a lab in the nevada desert.  just that sentence alone should clue you in to what is going to happen as nanotechonological ""critters"" are introduced into the ecosystem with a full fledged dose of predator-prey relationships.  though crichton tries to set the table for what is to come with an introduction to artificial eveolution in the 21st century, the early part of the novel spends way too much time on how stereotypical jack kids are and entirely too much time on just what he is preparing for dinner that night.  when jack is called into the nevada desert to serve as a consultant for xymos, things pick up, but just barely.

""prey"" begins with a lot of promise (compared to his last 2 dismal outings). good and interesting characters, background information that helps the story instead to halting the flow and a very interesting mystery. then, about halfway into the book, it suddenly becomes yet another standard hollywood screenplay. the characters become flat and lifeless; every 5 minutes there is a new desperate chase scene (they didn't work in jurassic park ii, they didn't work in timeline, but whoever bought the movie rights wants it, so michael writes it). the final battle and resolution is very empty and hollow and the motivations of the bad guys (see spoilers below) is completely lacking (but with plenty of room for a sequel hollywood!). the science and characters are interesting the action and plot is pure tinsel town.
mr. crichton certainly has enough personal wealth these days that he should be able to stand up to his editors and publishers and write the book he wants to write instead of what will sell in hollywood. the first half is a good as anything he has ever done, the second half is exactly the same anything he has done in the last 5 years.

""prey"" is an interesting concept, concerning the efforts to develop nanotechnology. of course, in crichton's world, science refuses to behave; arrogant scientists push limits and the scientific subjects break loose, causing a big mess and hijinx ensue. one right-thinking scientist warns against using the new technology before it is properly tested, then saves the day with his superior knowledge and skill.
in ""prey"", the hero is stay-at-home dad jack forman, a former programmer who loses his job because he finds out the ceo is morally-corrupt and tries to blow the whistle. crichton spends pages and pages describing how jack takes to being a house husband, changing diapers, fixing dinner, refereeing squabbles. we get the point: jack's a good guy, with capital letters.
jack's wife, julia, works for a company that has developed a medical imaging system that uses nanotechnology to take pictures of the inside of the body. this is the company for which things go terribly wrong. a cloud of nanoparticles breaks loose and is terroroizing the fabrication facility deep in the nevada desert.
because jack worked on the code that runs the particles, he's called in to save the day and this is where the book becomes ""jurassic nanoparticles"". at the facility, we are introduced to a group of people who are working on the project. their names are not important, for they are barely-sketched characters to be used as nano-fodder for the remainder of the novel.
the first third of the novel was almost unreadable. crichton attempts to get us into the head of joe average, having conversations about diapers and managing a household where the kids slap each other and call one another ""monkey butt"". but it appears crichton himself is a long, long way from being an average guy. i doubt he ever shopped for diapers or picked up his own dry-cleaning, so he instead seems to have cribbed all his knowledge of family life from ""mr. mom"" and ""e.t.""
things do heat up a bit when he gets to the facility in the desert. this is where crichton shows his chops as a master story teller. his writing is still a little sloppy and choppy, but he keeps things going by building and releasing tension at a steady rate. many questions are answered, only to raise more questions. this is what crichton does best and it is why i still read him.
plotting is a little sloppy, as well, as there are many inconsistencies throughout. people behave in odd ways, contact with the nanoparticles kills some but not others and has different affects on those it doesn't kill. but this is par for the course in a crichton novel.

8418,2,"michael crichton has made a career out of scientific cautionary tales, some of which are significantly better than others.  unfortunately, _prey_ is one of those others.
you already know the drill, right?  a small army of sci-fi/horror works have used it by now -- including _the thing_, more than a few episodes of _the x-files_, the _alien_ series, and a good half-dozen of crichton's previous books.  a small group of scientists, trapped in a remote location and unable to summon help, must fight for their lives against a deadly new species that they don't understand -- even if they've given rise to it themselves.  as always, the good guys have to venture out of their temporary refuge on various missions, only to be stranded and picked off due to unforeseen circumstances.  as always, there's a guy who wants to protect the enemy species out of greed.  and as always, just about everyone except for our hero winds up dead.  (anyone who considers any of this to be a spoiler probably doesn't get out much.)
unfortunately, _prey_ takes this time-tested formula and manages to make it singularly unconvincing.  for one thing, the good guys *aren't* unable to summon help until very late in the game.  while the full extent of the enemy's capabilities isn't immediately apparent, our hero has plenty of time after realizing that the team is in big trouble to find a darn phone and call in the big guns.  (if we're really supposed to believe that he doesn't do so because of company loyalty and/or a non-disclosure agreement, crichton needed to make a much stronger case.)  nor would the big guns find the enemy difficult to dispatch, because it's got more vulnerabilities than achilles had heels.  in other words, humankind is never in any real danger: about the worst that's going to happen here is that a few eggheads get iced, and half of them had it coming.
if _prey_ has a redeeming quality, it lies in crichton's highlighting of the very real risks of nanotechnology research.  yet dean koontz's _midnight_ covered the same territory over a decade ago on a much wider (and much scarier) scale.
it's hard to deny that crichton's work was a lot more enjoyable back when he actually had to work to sell a jillion copies.  will he ever again write anything half as good as _the andromeda strain_?  time will tell, but it's not looking likely.",it's been done better,1040947200,A27VTXX08JRVQ9,Ethan Straffin

8431,3,"i am a huge fan of rousseau's discourse on inequality, and was hoping to appreciate this book just as much. there is a telling irony in that in the former text, rousseau sees civilization as incapable of being repaired, and the source of most of the problems of inequality through wealth and politics. private property is an overall pariah to him, which ought not to exist.

as rousseau got older he seems to have changed his mind a bit, and tempered that anarcho-primitvism. in the social contract we see rousseau setting himself the task, he would have once found impossible: developing a legitimate state, in the interest of the sovereign, that constantly develops towards equality, and not away from it. unfortunately we are given zero insight into how the old ideology of the corrupt states, and rotten civilization are to be overcome at the moment of developing this grandiose social contract; this is a serious problem of praxis, probably not fully taken up until gramsci.

now it is worth pointing that rousseau's contract is significantly more radical, or left-wing, than anything locke, hegel, or hobbes proposed. rousseau does see excess property as a problem (unlike hegel), and unlike locke, rousseau does see the origin of property as corrupting, and not beneficial. moreover, rousseau categorically rejects the idea of slavery, and a wage slave. locke doesn't touch upon the former, and in a single line in his entire treatise, says a wage slave is a-ok. given the overall momentum of the treatise, it's a perplexing passage. rousseau asserts that labor ought to create products for itself and some excess for the community (so long as the community is doing the same), but not for private owners to capitalize on.

rousseau believes government ought to work for the general will of the sovereign, and the sovereign ought only to meet and conduct legislative that serves the interest of the general will. the general will is to be distinguished from the particular will, and an example of healthcare should suffice. it is the general will that each of us ought to have health coverage, i.e., because each of us desires particularly and also generally, and our desires ought to be towards equality. the particular will would desire health care, and if it comes at a cost to the general population, it ceases to be a product for and by the general will. i.e., i start a health care corporation so i get free benefits, and my family gets free benefits, but all my customers pay excess in premiums and co pays. this is the very the system that we have come to live in, where we are ""free"" to ""purchase"" in the ""free market."" rousseau would roll in his grave and point out the lunacy of atomizing society into particular wills in competition with one another, as a true travesty, acting against the general will.

although all these points are correct, or at least i appreciate most of them, the book still deserves 3 stars for a few reasons. there is certainly a tyrannical streak in rousseau, of supporting the death penalty, and demanding people be ""free"" by ""force"" and ""execution."" moreover, rousseau, like most social contract theorist, fails to consider the consequences of a minority who at first accepts the direction of the government, even if it votes against him constantly, to at a future date, resign his participation from a government he can no longer identify with; due to gradual change. socrates made the same absurd point in i believe the crito.

also rousseau at times is extremely contradictory, on one page arguing against tyranny, on another vesting individuals with tyrannical amounts of power; or demanding we are all free on one page, and on another that we are enslaved (at the same time). his notions of democracy are not properly fleshed out, and he believes one single law giver ought to bestow the contract in the communities' interest. while at the same time believing no human is capable of developing a lasting constitution. he implores us on one page to generate a government of everlasting and perennial general will; while on another saying no government whatsoever can avoid receding into tyranny and despotism.

his logic is frequently atrocious, and entirely emotional. this isn't inherently bad, emotion has its place in guiding reason, but do not present logical formulas as logical, when they are in fact entirely emotional. be candid. also, there's a constant reliance on appealing to authority -grotius- as whatever he says must be true, when rousseau decides to appeal to him.

still, if one finds themselves reading locke, hegel, and hobbes, or rand and hayak, maybe even novack, they ought to temper themselves with a good dosage of rousseau.",review,1343865600,A2053PPZKOLKZ2,CB

8433,3,"i am a big fan of crichton's past work, and ever since andromeda strain i have always looked forward to his new releases.  this book is similar to his past few in that it deals with the dark side of technology.  i found it not as scary as ""jurassic park,"" nor as interesting as ""timeline.""  this book is entertaining; however, with a slightly stronger plotline, it would have been an outstanding sci-fi thriller.
using a first-person narrative, the book is actually a nice introduction to the science of complexity theory, complex adaptive systems, emergence, networks, and of course, nanotechnology.  these topics have been on the forefront of scientific research during the past decade, and for those unfamiliar with these topics, this book serves a good (if not eye-opening) way to learn.  the idea of runaway nanomachines is not new, and along with genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, is frequently brought up by those who warn of the dangers of technology.  as pointed out in the book, humans as a species have a unique ability to screw things up, and murphy's law often occurs in unexpected ways.  the sobering fact is, since the advent of nuclear weapons, we now have the ability to destroy the planet.  out-of-control, genetically-engineered viruses or intelligent nanomachines simply add to this threat.
could the scenario presented in ""prey"" actually occur?  yes, although in the reality it could turn out to be much, much worse. in retrospect, i admit that this is my whole beef with the plot; with just a little more effort, the story could have involved a more terrifying, widespread threat, more sinister global villians, and/or a wider range of protagonists.  perhaps a less fortunate ending would have added to the perceived danger as well, leaving the reader with more food for thought.  it will be interesting to see how hollywood deals with this script (assuming it makes it to the big screen).  it could turn out to be more like ""sphere"" and less like the original ""jurassic park.""
unless you are collector of crichton's first editions, you might want to borrow this book from a friend or local library, pick up a used copy, or simply wait for the paperback to be published.  it is certainly not the worst crichton book i have ever read, nor is it, in my opinion, his finest.","ok read, but a bit disappointing",1040860800,A2LUTRITKO7CIC,Lowell E.

8455,3,"literature can both reflect societal moods and create them. this book may be an example of this cliche, as it is a jump start on a particular area of technology that is the subject of intense research at the present time: nanotechnology. there is talk about the possibility of self-replicating nanoscale robots, and with also the possibility that these entities could be intelligent, many individuals, scientists and non-scientists alike, feel apprehensive about this technology. the technology is not yet here, but developments in the 21st century are accelerating at an unprecedented rate.
 the book starts off well, at least after the introduction, which the author has felt the need to insert. the presence of the introduction is a distraction from the story line, at least for me personally, for i want to start the story without any biases or prejudices. the author's opinions in the introduction are somewhat negative about the future and character of humankind. a reader disagreeing with the author's opinions may be tempted to read the book with a hostile frame of mind. the author therefore should have kept his opinions to himself, and have spoken them through the characters in the book. he is clearly very worried about the developments in nanotechnology, and does not trust the scientific community to deal with it responsibly. the author though is bound by the constraint of making the story interesting, and that is hard to do without interjecting a large degree of malevolence in the technologies he is using in his story. friendly, helpful nanobots are not going to hold anyone's attention for long.
 the first 150 pages or so of the book were very exhilirating: the tension building in the mind of jack, the main character, and his doubts regarding his wife's behavior kept my attention. the author does a fine job of capturing his introspection, and in the meantime the reader gets a kind of crash introduction to terminology of evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligence. indeed, the reader gets exposed to talk of distributed parallel processing, or ""agent-based programs"", artificial life, ant routing, genetic algorithms, and protein folding, to name a few.
 as soon as jack enters the desert though, the story gets less credible. since this book has only been released for a few weeks, i could only say why i believe this by revealing the plot, which i don't want to do for the sake of new readers. i was surprised actually that the author took the move he did, as i was expecting the behavior of the nanobots to be much more subtle, as well as their detection. instead though their behavior was very extreme, and this led me to think of how easy they would be to combat. the behavior of the nanobots would be much more believable if they would have acted in more mischevious ways, and such behavior would follow i think more naturally from the first part of the book.
  as the story nears its end, the events become more and more unbelievable. in addition, the characters seem to be almost juvenile in their behavior, and the author has the annoying habit of having them constantly using the ""f-word"". this is supposed to (i guess) make them more realistic, but instead they come across like they are playing nothing more than a difficult video game. in addition, obvious countermeasures to the nano-swarms make the story less believable. one could for example program a collection of swarms to engage in battle with the malevolent ones.
 hence in general this is a disappointing book, which again is too bad considering the first part, which was written very well. i did not walk away with a feeling of foreboding that i did when reading the author's ""andromeda strain"" way back when. and if the book was meant to frighten the reader about the perils of nanotechnology, it missed its mark, considerably. but even if it did succeed in instilling fear about the possibility of nanotechnology, the research in this area will continue, and hopefully will be realized very soon.","well, the first part was really good",1040342400,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,Dr. Lee D.

actually, the disinterested wife fascinated me right up to the finish line.  for this, i was pleased.  the story is formulaic: doomed scientists frantically searching for the key to destroy the monster before the monster destroys them (and the world).  this monster is only impressive in numbers, not size.  microscopic computer chips programmed to be an ""eye in the sky"" for defense purposes.  individually, they are dumb; put a few billion together and they evolve very quickly.

8479,4,"this is a valuable historical document, because it shows us the thinking that led up to the french revolution.  rousseau wrote: ""man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains.""  what rousseau means by this is that man is born free in the state of nature - it is society, government, and urban life that are the corruptive forces.  without those things, rousseau argues, man would exist in peaceful co-habitation.  what is striking to the modern reader about this claim is how blatantly wrong it is.  rousseau was trying to refute thomas hobbes who wrote that the state of nature is the same as the state of war.  apparently hobbes got the better of the argument because, as soon as the french revolution took effect, peaceful liberty went out the window in favor of the reign of terror.
but, back to rousseau.  he claims that, even though men in nature peacefully co-exist, it is more beneficial for them to come together to form a society.  thus they should come together and form a social contract.  the ideal contract for rousseau would entail the individual giving up all his rights on entering the contract with the understanding that he will get them all back from the sovereign.  who is the sovereign?  well, for rousseau, the sovereign is the people.  if rousseau's ideal state were an organism, it would be a large one-celled organism with no differentiation.  this is very much unlike hobbes' leviathan, with the sovereign at the head and each part assigned its individual task.  for rousseau, only the society as a whole has the right to govern.
of course, this system is incredibly unwieldy, that is why - in rousseau's world - there are a whole bunch of little city-states, like ancient athens.  here comes the scary part.  once the whole population gets together and makes a decision, that decision is infallible.  ""the general will cannot be wrong.""  those minorities who are disaffected by this general rule shall be ""forced to be free.""  in the case of the french revolution, that was the freedom of one's head from one's shoulders.
according to simon schama in his wonderful book, citizens, the importance of the social contract has been overestimated.  rousseau's love of the state of nature (which was the spirit of the french revolution) had more of an effect on the public through his novels emile and la nouvelle heloise.
the social contract must be viewed in its historical context as a piece of history in itself.  if one reads it for philosophic reasons only, it will come of sounding either frightening or painfully nave.  one sentence caught my imagination however - rousseau saw the island of corsica as the perfect candidate for his ideal state.

8495,3,"crichton's always been one of my favorite authors; i knew i could count on a well-written techno thriller that i couldn't put down.  unfortunately, this one doesn't deliver.  it's just too darn predictable!
perhaps starting the book at the end of the story is too much of a giveaway (the novel starts on ""day 7"" and then recounts the events of the prior 6 days).  based on the events in the first few pages, you know exactly where the story is going to end when something is revealed halfway through the book.  being told in the first person doesn't help either.  you know our protagonist is going to survive any of his numerous near-death encounters, as well as many of the other characters who are present in the first few pages.  this of course removes much of the suspense.
this is probably the most predictable novel i've ever read.  scene after scene, as the road curved ahead, i knew exactly what was around the next bend.  utterly disappointing in that regard.
chrichton certainly has a stock formula for most of his ""science-gone-amuck"" novels.  well-intentioned scientists create something that's going to be fantastic, taking shortcuts and dangerous innovations, the technology goes rogue, people die, the technology is destroyed (or is it?).  this one's ture to that previously successful formula, but again, it disappoints.  the only chrichton novel (or movie) that disappointed more was ""congo.""
that said, it's still worth the read.  i did enjoy it, and it's an interesting technology, with some interesting explanations of the problems, both technical and moral that are presented.
the hardcover price is outrageous, but most hardcover prices are outrageous in today's economy.  i'd wait for the paperback, or even the movie, which is sure to be made.",too predictable!  too chrichton-formulaic.,1039305600,A288WSYL9XWOCL,Amazon Customer
8497,5,"let me start by trying to explain to my long-suffering editor why i started reading prey, michael crichton's new novel, when i had a groaning table full of books assigned to be reviewed before that one. as i write this, i can see her nodding bemusedly on the other side of the e-mail ether as she reads my explanation which, although true, sounds lame-o, even to me.
all i did was pick up prey and started skimming crichton's introduction to get a glimmer of what it was about. the title of the introduction --- artificial evolution in the twenty-first century --- hooked me. so i read the introduction, which begat the prologue. and the prologue begat chapter one. and behold, before i knew it, i was at page 20 plus 100. the temple virgins had extinguished the vessels and night had fallen. and i kept reading.
just try to stop. crichton does with prey what he does so well, which is to take what's happening right now and extrapolate it to take a peek at what might happen tomorrow. or this afternoon. or maybe five minutes ago.
prey concerns something called nanotechnology --- and we're not talking about devices to help your italian mother. nanotechnology, or molecular manufacturing, is something else. i'm going to really oversimplify it here, because i'm no good at all at explaining anything more complex than a soup sandwich, but here goes: we can't physically manufacture microchips any smaller than we currently do now, so we're going to grow them and make them self-replicating. the practical applications are enormous, mind-boggling and, as arthur c. clarke said about the universe, more than we are able to imagine.
the problem is whether or not we are going to be able to control these chips. as they come into contact with more and more elements in the biosphere, the greater the opportunity they will have to interact, adapt and evolve. and what happens if they become deliberately and consciously opportunistic? well, crichton provides one possible scenario to this and one possible answer. and believe me, you won't be more than a third of the way into prey before you consider that your wacky luddite niece may be worth listening to.
prey is told through the voice of jack forman, a systems guy who is a victim of silicon valley intrigue. as he unwillingly slips gradually into the role of a stay-at-home husband, his wife, a dynamic woman who is vice-president of a technology firm, becomes more involved in a secret project and exponentially more distant. he initially suspects that she might be having an affair; by the time he discovers the truth, he'll wish it was that simple. in fact, his wife has been working on a method of growing molecules. but the blessing of its creators and in the interest of science, this project has spun out of control. one reading of prey and you'll never look at a summer swarm of insects at sunset the same way again.
prey is a cautionary tale, in the same vein as the andromeda strain and rising sun. one reading and you'll find that the big, bulky eight pound laptop you're lugging around is quite small enough. anything smaller might not be worth the cost.

8511,3,"this book explores almost the exact same themes as jurassic park ... only not quite as masterfully. it has the same flow as the preceding book, timeline: start with a hip premise, insert a some technical background, have the protaganists interact with the technology, but instead of expanding upon these themes, the books final 100 pages or so morph into a half-hearted adventure yarn.
i really wanted to like this book as it is ostensibly based on an area of interest to me: nems (nanotechnology). actually the book covers a lot of themes: male/ female role reversal a la disclosure, innate unpredictability of complex systems - jurassic park, bleeding edge technology with which scientists take shortcuts - jp and timeline, as well as corporate conspiracy and coverups - basically all of mc's books. however the book spends most of its energy on evolution, emergent behavior, and ai. this really is not a book about nano.
all of this being said, the book is interesting and a page turner. i read it in one sitting. the problems of the book are most noticeable when compared with some of crichton's best work like jurassic park or sphere. prey does not really explore the human element as it relates to the technologies on which the story is built. this is actually odd because it seems as though mc spends a good deal of the book providing a lot of background for both the protaganist and the technologies. unfortunately, he drops them cold when in the the end, the book devolves quickly into a b movie horror replete with big explosions, chases, fights, more explosions, and an abrupt one page summary of all that has just transpired. bummer.
in summary: an enjoyable enough read, that has a lot of potential but hastily squanders it in the end and for that reason falls way short of of mc's best books. if you have not yet done so, pick up jurassic park or a case of need instead.",same themes different vehicle,1038787200,AINFVSQGK1SSD,S.

8513,3,"michael crichton has been vastly successful financially but positive critical reviews of his works have been far and few.  unfortunately, his latest novel prey will probably not usher in waves of praise.  it is too bad because crichton deals with issues that are pertinent to all people and his ideas are supported by relevant research.
prey reads like an expanded movie script where action scenes have been fleshed out with perfunctory swiftness.  this book is disappointingly a second-rate effort when compared to his similarly themed, yet vastly superior jurassic park.  in that masterpiece, crichton successfully evoked descriptive terror while entertaining the reader.  but in that work, people were able to rely on mental pictures of dinosaurs from childhood memories and such so crichton didn't need to work as hard to deliver the frightening images.  here, the menacing entities are nanoparticles - particles that are significantly smaller than the width of a human hair.  while these nanoparticles wreak havoc through predatory behavior, they still lack a cogent character.  while a future technology appears to be far more dangerous than say an extinct animal, the effort in making nanoparticles terrifying comes up short.  this may not be entirely crichton's fault as nanotechnology is not as commonplace to people as genetic technologies and thus does not deliver the suspense that crichton has so successfully conjured in novels past.
jack forman, the protagonist, is a stay-at-home father of three who was fired from his last job for blowing the whistle on his boss.  fortunately for him, his wife julia just happens to vice president for xymos technologies, a secretive firm that is conducting hush-hush experiments in the nevada desert when jack is hastily hired to firefight some serious programming problems.  meanwhile his wife inexplicably begins to exhibit indignant and strange behavior and upsetting the home-life balance that jack has persevered to achieve.  can there be some connection with her job or is this crichton exploring the gender role reversal a la disclosure?
the first third of the book sluggishly takes place mostly at jack's home and here crichton seems to be unable to find any pace in writing about domestic living.  for such a large chunk of text, the characters' dialogue is poorly written (especially the children's).  crichton shines best when he exercises his wonderful gift of explaining abstract scientific concepts in layman's terms.  the passages about the nanotechnology, emergent behavior and biological terms make for interesting reading in sharp contrast to his domestic diatribe.
prey is recommended for its ruminations on science but only if you can tolerate the prosaic passages about some of the characters' home life and mundane action scenes.  the bibliography at the end does provide an outstanding springboard learning about the scientific principles presented in the book.",crichton keeps preying for better reviews,1038787200,APQXOOQ1J8TR2,Bhavin Trivedi
8514,2,"as with all of crichton's work, this one is extremely well researched, and makes some complicated and rather futuristic science accessible to a broader range of the public.  it also conveys the reader along its suspenseful plot with eager turns of the page (you'll be able to turn through this one during a typical flight).  however, it's also characteristic of crichton's recent novels - pedantic, almost as if it's written for imbeciles, leaving no suspense except to find out what's going to _happen_ next - rather than what the characters (and readers) are going to _learn_ next.  i don't think the first person narrative helps with this problem.
for people who have done absolutely no reading about emergent systems, biological models for technology, or nanotechnology, this book may be a good primer.  (though i believe it needed a stronger editor, i prefer neal stephenson's _the diamond age_ as a more prophetic vision of the dangers of nanotechnology.)  crichton's _prey_ treats its readers as if they're not smart enough to put together some pretty obvious connections, and then strays off its solid science to a rather frivolous - and painfully, incessantly telegraphed - fright for an ending.
as with his dinosaur books, crichton appears to be writing a screenplay rather than a novel.  and, frankly, _west world_ and the terrifically underrated _looker_ and _runaway_ were much better examples of his skill in that arena.  for readers interested in well written and solidly plotted science thrillers, i'd recommend crichton's earlier work, such as _the andromeda strain_ and _the terminal man_, or neal stephenson's _cryptonomicon_.",typical of crichton's slow decline,1038787200,A2DYOFW5QRYPJ1,David B. Schlosser
8515,4,"ever since i read the andromeda strain  shortly after its publication in 1969, i have been a michael crichton fan and have always eagerly awaited his next book. and prey is quintessential michael crichton, a story to tell and a message to get across. he begins with an introduction that discusses the recent advances in technology and warns of his concerns regarding their dangers. (just as jurassic park was not only a great story, but a book about the possible abuses of cloning.)
unfortunately, while i have enjoyed several of his recent works, in my estimation few of them, including this one, fulfill the promise of the his first novel. first, his recent books seem to be written primarily to become movies, in fact this one is almost indistinguishable from a film script. (and it could be a five star movie, but book readers need more detail and character development.) second, as the review by roger buffington indicates, as i understand the technologies involved, the events in this story are highly improbable and some crucial developments go unexplained. (i cannot describe them in detail without giving away the plot.) third, while the author attempted to clear up a lot of the loose ends in the final chapter, i found the conclusion to be relatively unsatisfactory.
the story opens with jack forman, an unemployed computer programmer and software engineer, playing the role of mr. mom while his wife julia pursues her career at xymos technologies. she is a former venture capitalist turned corporate vp in charge of a top secret apparently ""bet the company"" project in which xymos is engaged. the project involves biotechnolgy, nanotechnology, massively parallel computer processing systems and extensive software development of learning algorithms. as the project nears deadline, the pressure on julia intensifies, and as their relationship deteriorates jack suspects that she may be having an affair with someone at the company lab where she is spending an increasing amount of time. the project goes seriously awry, and jack is called in as a consultant and soon learns the ominous truth. the machine has mutated and escaped from the lab and is acting as a lethal virus that has the potential not only to murder the lab employees but infect the human race. nothing is as it first appears, and the race against time begins to halt the spread of the virus.
this is a true techno thriller and very fast paced. all the action takes place within seven days, and in fact in a very effective technique the chapter breaks consist of discrete rapidly moving time segments in sequential order. thus, despite my reservations i found the book hard to put down until i had finished it, which is one of the reasons why i decided after much reflection it deserved as high as a four star rating. also, the discussions of the technologies involved were quite interesting and well done. i am familiar in concept with several of them and found this part of the book very enjoyable. (however, if you are not scientifically literate, you will have to either skim them and accept the premises of the book or they will slow you down cosiderably.) also, while the premise seemed implausible, once accepted the story was internally consistent.
the book suffered from two additional irritating flaws. first, several developments were well telegraphed to the reader, yet despite jack's obvious intelligence and attention to detail he was oblivious to the implications of certain events and some of julia's actions. also the last chapter was a forced attempt to clear up some of the unexplained happenings, but seemed to be an afterthought addendum which still left several crucial things not cleared up to my satisfaction.
while i recommend this book with the aforementioned reservations, i would suggest that anyone interested in a serious discussion of the topic read the article by bill joy, the respected chief scientist at sun microsystems, which appeared in wired magazine a couple of years ago about the dangers of technological innovations developing human like intelligence capabilities. at times as i was rading prey it seemed as if that article had been the genesis of michael crichton's plot line. also, if you are interested in a truly prescient sci fi story regarding the potential of self replicating machines, read the short story autofac by the great philip k. dick. (it is included in the collection titled minority report and other stories - the title story is a great classic and much better than the movie.) in conclusion, i believe that michael crichton's introduction to prey indicates that he had a message that he wanted to convey (and his cautions are in fact well taken); nevertheless, while he developed the story in an entertaining and arresting manner, he stretched the technologies involved to do so and also ignored the historical evidence that technology and human ingenuity have much more often been the source of progress than disaster.",a worthwhile and compelling read but far from his best book,1038700800,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,Tucker Andersen
8516,3,"(3 & 1/2 stars) the best way to read a crichton novel is to recognize up front that it is nothing more than popular entertainment.  just surrender to it and go along for what will be a very enjoyable ride.  with prey, as with other previous novels by this author, there is an exciting story that's mostly quick and easy reading.  as the cliched blurb quote says, it's a real page-turner.
the ""villain"" of the story is the nanoswarm, rendered in appropriately cool and menacing descriptions by crichton.  the ""hero,"" jack, is a fairly believable character as he gets deeper into the web of xymos, the company making the nanoswarms.  as other reviewers have noted, the movie rights for prey have already been sold, and it will translate well to the big screen (with a large sfx budget).
there are some flaws with prey that caused me to give it a slightly lower rating.  the scientific explanations are sometimes boring, and distract from the narrative flow.  for example, try this passage which pops up right in the middle of jack's first moments at the xymos fabrication plant:  ""the technical definition of emergent behavior was behavior that occured in a group but was not programmed into any member of the group.  emergent behavior could occur in any population, including a computer population.""  that's just an excerpt from a page-long lecture.  well, ""yawn...""
the intro, another college lesson from mr. crichton, is something to skip -- especially since it repeats verbatim the same exact two quotes that begin the book!  there were also a few credibility gaps and holes in the story, but none serious enough to get in the way of the thrill ride of this made-for-hollywood book.  it makes for a great afternoon or two of armchair escapism.","not great literature, but still a fun read",1038700800,A4OSXRZR2BMX8,William Merrill
8519,3,"i'm a big mc fan and have greatly enjoyed all of his previous books with the exception of terminal man & now, prey.
the problem with his latest is that it is a bit close to the now typical mc scenario. we know the protagonist isn't going to die because mc chose to write the book in first person. when the hero describes the players in the scenario, we as readers literally pick who is going to suffer the book's titular fate and who is not. (for the record, i was right about the victims!) we then turn pages to see how close we were to our predictions and also to see how gruesome their particular fates are going to be.
this is normally escapist fun but this book is a shade too melodramatic and formulaic to reach that level. also, while resurrecting dinosaurs on a large scale & traveling to another dimension/time is obviously not plausible, mc truly made it seem like these advances in technology were right around the corner. the technology here - nanobots ""breeding"" and turning slightly malevolent in their choice of sustenance while the protagonist happens to be the only person able to stop them - is just too far away to make it seem like this is possible; this book is a shade too clearly on the science fiction portion of the literary spectrum. the final fate of some of the book's characters is pretty far out there.
i will say that i shivered and got itchy while reading the book & that i had to read it in one sitting just to see where it was going. i also enjoyed one portion that seemed nearly lifted from 'aliens'. however, this is the 'star trek 3' of mc's oeuvre - wait for the paperback and its sure-to-be-lurid cover if you simply must read it.",a rare misfire from my favorite author,1038614400,A23X3P1PEV402V,Andrew A.

8524,3,"as in all michael crichton novels, the heart of this novel is crichton's fascinating scientific speculation--in this novel about the implications of nanotechnology.  nanotechnology is the science of manufacturing microscopic machines.  this novel speculates about what might happen if this technology ran amok.
i've read nearly all of crichton's books, and this one is remarkably different from the others as regards the writing style.  this novel is not written with crichton's usual detached, third-person style, moving periodically among characters.  instead, the narrative is in the first person--everything is seen from the perspective of one protagonist, who slowly, gradually, realizes the horror of the situation in which he finds himself.  the overall effect of this change in style is that the book is a much easier read than most of crichton's other work.  in fact, it is fair to say that more than most of crichton's other novels, this one is a real page-turner.  mostly he does not sacrifice depth for this, and he does achieve a higher degree of clarity than in some of his other novels, notably ""timeline.""
some of crichton's scientific prognostications are (as usual for him) absolutely fascinating.  he clearly and convincingly explains how nanotechnology may come together as a fusion between mechanical and genetic engineering, and computer science.  unfortunately, in my opinion in this novel he goes a bit too ""far out"" in that i did not find his speculation about the ultimate conclusion of the technology to be plausible.  most crichton novels pass the ""plausibility test""--even ""timeline"" did an acceptable job of suggesting a convincing scenario in which time travel might be possible--a difficult task indeed.  while i found some of crichton's speculation about where nanotechnology might lead to be fascinating, some parts of this speculation seemed forced and ultimately not believable.  this lack of plausibility dropped this one to three stars in my opinion.
the ending of the novel is also not very satisfying.  crichton could have done better.  spoilers omitted here.

8581,3,"first of all i would like to emphasize that the philosophical and psychological approaches in this book are almost all good, some excellent and that most of them make you think about them for quite a while.

as criticism from my part, i would like to warn possibly interested readers that this is foremost a book about mathematics and physics. if you have no interest in these, do not wonder if you get exasperated having to read about them all of the time, or don't start reading at all.

and then, here we come to my second and by far more important criticism: anna is by far the most horrible mary sue i ever came across with. (the term ""mary sue"" is a synonym for a fictitious person who is extremely idealized and ostensibly perfect, always at the middle of the attention and loved by everybody.) the author wants us to believe that this is a ""true story"": well, i didn't believe it. which child of six / seven years can already read, write and make sums perfectly? in the end of course she has to die dramatically after a rescue campaign. there is never a word about the smallest flaw or weakness in this super-human little girl who, so it is said, has a ""particular relationship"" with god.
wrong, dear reader: she is god, and an obnoxious, conceited god at that. the whole book is nothing but an endless adulation and detailed description of anna's unique superiority, including the incessant mortifications she bestows on the people around her, who nevertheless can't help but adore her. so much arrogance is unbearable and made it extremely difficult for me to read the book until the end.

to pretend that such a person is respectively was real in order to make one's convictions and philosophies of life more credible was an imprudent and tactless manoeuvre by the author. the ideas described here are at times very wise and would have made me think without the need of this ""heart-wrenching little girl"" bringing them into focus. additionally, the reader never gets to know where anna actually came from, although the book did announce an explanation at the beginning. one more reason to make the reader assume that she probably fell directly from heaven. and in the end her arrogance finds its peak in her firm conviction that ""mister god"" will of course let her into paradise.

miss haynes: ""you have seven sweeties in one hand and nine sweeties in your other hand. how many sweeties have you got altogether?""
anna: ""none, i ain't got none in this hand and ain't got none in this hand, so i ain't got none, and it's wrong to say i have if i ain't.""
miss haynes: ""i mean pretend, dear, pretend that you have.""
anna: ""fourteen.""
miss haynes: ""oh no, dear, you've got sixteen. you see, seven and nine make sixteen.""
anna: ""i know that, but you said pretend, so i pretended to eat one and i pretended to give one away, so i've got fourteen.""

this only as an example. for so much impudence, which is good for no one and nothing and, in this case, humiliates her teacher before her whole class, anna is being portrayed throughout the book like some kind of miniature saint. sorry for saying this, but had she been my pupil, i would have beaten her to an inch of her life.","a very intelligent book, nevertheless annoying (spoiler alert)",1391817600,A2PJUHR9LD9XKZ,Skywalker

i did not like the book, but i love the story. i read this story on a borrowed book and loved it so much i ordered this. i was very disappointed by the book and the print size, both of which were too small for me to handle and to read comfortably. also the paper quality was cheap. the book arrived in good condition though. i returned it and the seller was good enough to refund my money.  i'm sharing this in case book and print size and paper quality matter to you too. i found a different book of this story that was also cheap but which i was very happy with. so please read this wonderful story, but you might want to do so on a different book than this one.","love the story, did not like the book quality.",1210204800,A3QQ7CL7HLQOTQ,Maria Gekcho
8634,3,"the book recounts the friendship formed between the author and narrator fynn (who is in his late teens or early 20s in the narrative) and a foundling named anna in london's east end, in the 1930s. anna, reminiscent of a character from dickens, is a little girl who lives on the streets until she is taken in by the narrator. she has a unique perspective on life, a mystical spirituality, and a boundless curiosity that she shares with the author and the reader on every page. she occasionally (at least once per chapter) lets loose with a metaphor or pronouncement that is as deep as they come, but it is hard to imagine a real five-year old spouting these profundities with such regularity.  was she a real kid or just a figment of the author's imagination? i have no idea, but i do know that her death in the final chapter (this isn't a spoiler---fynn tells us about her death in the first few pages) felt real enough.

i loved the characters of fynn and anna, yet i have mixed feelings about the book itself. it was given to me as a gift by a good friend, who in turn had it recommended to him. both recommendations came with the suggestion that the book had substantially shifted their perspectives. yet in reading the book, i could never shake my suspicion that the author was just using sentimental tricks to make the book seem profounder than it really was. (it felt like the same kind of emotional manipulation that i associate with the movie forrest gump.) put it this way: if the wise-sounding comments had come from an adult, rather than from a small homeless child, would they still have seemed as deep?

8644,1,"this is a formula book, aimed at people who are already convinced of the existence of their god. it's as realistic as one of the medieval lives of the saints, and as subtle as anything from stalinist russia, where heroic peasants worked heroically for the common heroic good.
here a little girl uses the socratic method to ""enlighten"" her guardian in the ways of god. the character of the little girl will be unrecognizable to anyone who's ever encountered a real child for more than five seconds. this would be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the philosophy is threadbear. only an uncritical acceptance of second-hand ideas coupled to a second-rate god would make this an interesting work.
the writing itself is workmanlike enough, though this doesn't preclude the inevitable tedium that comes from the subject matter itself.
in other words, it's a false piece of writing, just as hagiography was false and heroic socialistic heroism was false.  spare yourself this juvenile meandering.  if you really want to know something about the way god has evolved in the west, take a look at karen armstrong's book a history of god. far more interesting and insightful, and much more capably written as well.",lives of the saints revisited,1080518400,A1LMBOI3T91P87,Allan M.

8712,3,"it's no secret that by this point sir arthur conan-doyle was bored with sherlock holmes and wished to let him go forever but the public kept hounding him and he only wrote them out of obligation. the lack of inspiration shows and the stories seem generic.

a few of them are not even told from watson's perspective, with one being a rather odd third-person story and two being told by holmes himself. perhaps the constant narration by watson is what led to so many movies casting conan-doyle lookalikes to play him as a bumbling fool who does no more than follow holmes around. or maybe conan-doyle was just trying to experiment by not sticking to formula. but watson is missed in the story 'the lion's mane', in which there isn't even any damn crime committed. and there's not even any mystery in the 'veiled lodger' story. it was 19 pages of pointlessness!

don't get me wrong, there are couple of good stories, such as 'the blanched soldier' and the one with the wife who commits suicide (the name of that story escapes me). but 'the case of the sussex vampire' and 'the creeping gentlemen' have intriquing set-ups but lame endings. and in the case of the latter, just down-right far-fetched and ill-fitting in the holmes universe.

i think the main problem with most of these is that the never really go anywhere. literally. holmes seems to solve them without even leaving his office. come on! let's go out and have an adventure rather than staying in and doing work!

8760,3,"i just read this book to finish reading the complete conon doyle holmes series.

i agree with those who say the stories here fail to live up to the standard of the previous.  i found myself with every story conclusions finding issue: instead of the usual awe over holmes' intuitive brilliance, my reaction tended to be ""that would have been obvious"", or ""that made no sense"", or ""there was no way to conclude that from the clues.""

the writing, on the other hand, is fine.  character descriptions were excellent, and it was novel to be able to read two stories from holmes', rather than watson's, perspective.  so it's worthy reading to a holmes & watson fan, a fan who's read all preceding works in the collection, but it hardly ranks with the all-time greats in the mystery genre, unlike virtually any of the conon doyle holmes works.

two favorites were the illustrious client, which contained a very strong character, and the veiled lodger, which was a nice variation on the usual paradigm.  so please read this book, but don't make it your first holmes exposure.",good stuff but not in the same class as preceding conon doyle,1377907200,A1UMVK332GJ0PO,Daniel J.

 the cat in the hat brings us to the acme of children's book writing.  this beginner book for very young readers has every thing we want in a book for the smallest readers, those who still have adults reading to them as they look on and see the words.  those few among us who have not read this to their children or those few who have not had cat read to them have missed a great deal.
 the drawing by dr. seuss have a dynamism, a quirkiness and a charm that we do not find anywhere else.  we and the littles love to see the cat and his pals, thing one and thing two.  the short, sharp words should be known to the children by the time they are old enough to look this book over.  they can now match the sound of the word 'cat' or 'fish' to the written representation of that word.  by repetition and rhyme the sound will implant with the visual, written word.

one, clear and concise goals which are aptly named one minute goals.
two, immediate praise with clear feedback on what was done well. which blanchard names one minute praisings.
three, immediate reprimands with clear feedback on what wasn't done well and making clear that it's not personal but only work performance.

these three rules are placed in a narrative that takes up most of the pages of the book. while it keeps you reading, the rules are typically agreed upon to be universal through the narrative. so blanchard essentially validates the theories about management that were put forth by himself.

9087,3,"this is a diary that albert speer wrote while in spandau prison. i wasn't sure what to expect when i began. speer is obviously very intelligent and is a great master with language; even has a very poetic style. however, i was hoping to gain more insight into the nazi regime, but instead about 80% of this book contains his description of daily life in prison. a typical example is speer talking about planting vegetables. this might be interesting to me if this was a story about a man alone on a desert island, but this is a former nazi member. also, he adds dream sequences in his dialog, and it's hard to tell whether it is real or fantasy. inside the third reich by speer is a far better book.

speer also asks himself a question. if he could do it all over again would he much rather be an anonymous architect? i found it revealing that he couldn't answer the question. was he really repentant? i'm not so sure. there are two things i found very interesting. speer writes, ""now i understood that for hitler they were almost like rites of the founding of a church...in order to gain the far greater status of founder of a religion.""(in regards to formations, parades, and processions)
speer also writes, "" i always thought that his (hitler) immense energy was to be devoted to the german people...now all these masks had dropped away...nothing but iciness...""

yes indeed hitler was a religious leader starting his own religion, and it ended with the destruction of germany an the german people.

9462,3,"the books we find most insightful are usually the ones that remind us of things weve simply forgotten. they don't teach us something new, they simply remind us in a unique and powerful way of something we already knew.

that is exactly how id describe the one minute manager. the authors wrote a simple book full of common sense  and thus the book makes total sense.

this book sold 13 million copies! its only 106 pages, with about 200 words per page. why would we pay 12 dollars for such a short book?

because it speaks to us  it reminds us to be people  and that we can succeed and make money and make friends better if we do.

great lessons:
1. people who feel good about themselves produce good results.
2. if you don't like the way things are, but you don't know what you want changed  then you don't have a problem, you're just complaining. once you know what you want changed  then you have a problem and can work toward a solution.
3. people are motivated by praise more than scolding.
4. when there are problems, attack the behavior, not the person doing it.
5. ive never seen an unmotivated person after work. (people get excited and motivated when they are looking forward to something  like what they get to do after work. so figure out how to get them excited about work)
6. take a minute  see if your behavior matches your goals.
7. the key to training someone to do a new task is, in the beginning, to catch them doing something approximately right until they can eventually learn to do it exactly right.
8. most employees aren't trying to produce or accomplish anything anymore other than they're trying to get paid without getting in trouble.
9. manipulation is getting people to do something they are either unaware of or don't agree to.
10. goals begin behaviors. consequences maintain behaviors.",common sense revealed,1391990400,ACWR0PN85BBGN,Simple Citizen

9470,3,"i remember owning this book when i was a kid, but had totally forgotten the story of it. now i have a daughter just 14 months old, so i ordered this to have something to read to her. now the story does come back to me, and oddly perhaps, i find it a just bit disturbing. i guess it is just me. i was an extremely shy child, loyal to just a couple close friends but never liking groups or meeting new people. i still do not like being in a group very much, or going to bars or parties. from my point of view, here is this aggressive, back-slapping, hand-shaking, smooth-talking stranger cat, you let him into your life as a friend, next thing you know things are spiralling out of control as more and more strangers are forced upon you, each more removed from your standards of morality and responsible behavior than the last. how you have ultimately disgraced your family name... yet it is hard to say at what exact instant should you have put your foot down, without appearing rude and unreasonable. i can dimly recall being frightened a bit by this book as a child, and i wonder now if it reinforced my natural tendency towards introversion and reclusiveness.

then there was the time i captured a ""daddy-long-legs"" spider in kindergarten and the teacher gave me a jar to keep it in, but all the other kids wanted to ""look"" at it but actually poked it with pencils so by the time i stepped off the school bus at home my spider was just a squished blob with weakly twitching legs. it was my duty to protect that spider, but i failed miserably to counter the assertive and cruel attitudes of my classmates.

9497,4,"at the beginning of the year, jeff sat down with our team and challenged us to set some goals. we're not really goal setters here. we're working on it, because we see the value of it. typically goal setting hasn't been the easiest or most intuitive thought process for our team. but the one goal that has been really fun for me to work on is a reading list.

on the top of the list was the one minute manager by kenneth h. blanchard and spencer johnson. the book tells a story and recounts the 3 main management tips through the story. set clear goals, praise successes, reprimand bad behavior.

that's it. well, there are a few more tips in how to do it in a positive way that will produce the behavior you're looking for, but it was a pretty straightforward look at how to take minimal amounts of time to create productivity and efficiency in your team. there will be a few things i definitely incorporate into my work. i agree that it is absolutely essential for your team to undersand the goal at hand, and to be set in a direction to be able to accomplish the goal.

secondly, the authors made a big point to look for what team members are doing right. they say to focus on and reinforce good behavior instead of bad behavior. this is something i would really like to work on within my team, and in my personal life. it sounds like a great way to work within relationships in general.

it gives an insight into a relationship between a mother and her 15 year old daughter, not just a glimpse of their everyday lives but their worries and concerns when the mother has a health scare. the author captures the confusing and conflicting emotions both of them experience and although short, it's to the point and gets across what i feel was intended; not only to appreciate and enjoy those we sometimes take for granted but also to communicate with each other. that doesn't mean just telling someone we love them but appreciating that we need to share our happiness and our inner worries with them too sometimes.

9511,2,"the manager who manages best manages the least. that's the big takeaway from this book.

it's mostly true and there's some basic elemental truth in this title. people are people, and regardless of the time period or work environment, they still operate in the same ways and respond to the same incentives.

however, the writing is absolutely wretched. i couldn't wait to finish reading the book and plowed through the last few chapters by sheer force of will. on the positive side, the book is mercifully short.

i'll sum it up right here: give your employees clear goals. let them know early what success looks like and how they can achieve it. give immediate feedback and focus on the positive. actually care about their growth and well being. if an employee has a problem, tell them immediately, and make sure you make it about their actions, not about them personally.

people want to know you respect them as a person and they do best when they know what's expected. many managers don't let people know if they're doing a good job or a bad job until it's too late to fix it, and too many focus on the ""no news is good news"" style of management.

if you didn't know these things already, maybe you should read the book -- it'll explain why all that works. otherwise, skip it. it's a short but painful read.","good advice, but terribly written.  almost painful for the reader.",1369353600,A2MRTFIDEAPZJ1,K. McCauley

9521,2,"this is described as ""a novel in notes"", i'm not sure a 20 minute read constitutes a novel but maybe i'm just being picky.

i found it a very unsatisfying read, not surprisingly there is no character development whatsoever, which i could forgive if the characters were more interesting.

the major event of the book is a life altering one but it is handled in a clichd way, with the content of the messages and the responses nothing you haven't heard or read before. which would also have been ok if the writing was beautiful or witty or funny or something, but it is just plain - as you'd expect notes left on a fridge to be. because of this they failed to evoke a strong emotional response in me and i think the situation should have.

in a way it sort of reads like a parable, it is attempting (i think in a heavy handed, unsubtle way) to remind us to spend time communicating with those we love and to make time for what is important in our lives, as the time available is finite and could be ripped away from us at any minute.
which is a worthwhile message but presentation is everything and the superficial way this is presented means i can dispose of it without much thought - which, for me, is a bit sad. i like a book that makes me think.",not worth the effort,1322438400,A10G2V87XVYHTB,SHR

i have to confess, this is one of those times when i was blinded in my book choice by my own personal issues.  my teenage daughter and i are going through a ""patch,"" and i was caught by the book's supertitle:  notes between a mother and daughter.  be advised - that little inclusion is not an exaggeration.  the entire book is written in note form.  you're left to do the detective work in filling in the plot between the scribbles.  while i give the author points for trying this interesting concept, it created too shallow of a storyline.","drivel, drivel, drivel",1225670400,AHVXFU25YRSMV,Stacey @ Scenic Life Designs
9541,2,"as most of the other reviewers have stated, this is an extremely fast read.  i didn't find the characters particularly compelling, in spite of the tragic circumstances of the novel; kulper's unconventional (but interesting) method of letting the story unfold solely through notes left on a refrigerator limits the depth of the characters and their story, and leaves the reader feeling somewhat detached from the whole experience.","interesting concept, but falls short",1205625600,A3LE67UTFF4AQJ,Michael
9543,2,"the best thing i can say about this ""novel"" and i hate to call it a novel, despite the fact it is over 200 pages in length, is it was shallow, predictable, and disappointing.  even a slow reader can finish the book in about 20 minutes, as most pages have only one or two lines of print on them.  the total word count for the book is probably less than that of the average short story.  thus, i have a difficult time calling this book a ""novel."" by no means can the book be considered novel length.

the characters are shallow, perhaps by design, i do not know, and the plot is as thin as the book.  the mother is not given a name, thus the reader is robbed of any empathy toward her, despite the fact she is a victim of breast cancer.  sadly we know more about the daughter's boyfriend than we do about her mother.  plus, it was hard to work up a lot of emotion for a mother who put her career ahead of her relationship with her daughter.  no wonder she is divorced (as her daughter so aptly tells her, in a note, of course).

the story was extremely predictable.  after only a few pages, it was obvious (to me at least) that the mother would die at the end and the daughter would be ok.  too much foreshadowing, perhaps.  but the predictibility robs the reader of most of the suspense and tension in the book.  the only suspense is what happens before the mother dies.

overall, the book was very disappointing.  it is an interesting concept, to tell their story through a series of notes on the refrigerator door, but the story came up short.

the story's about a mother and daughter, who never see each other, they're like ships in the night, they pass each other. the mother's a busy doctor, the daughter's busy at school and her social life.

the mother discovers she has breast cancer, and suddenly, the relationship between the two changes. it's painstakingly honest, but too brief. you're made to feel like the daughter's selfish and doesn't care. which didn't feel quite right.

this is a quaint little talk that takes the reader on a visit to a highly effective manager's office where this manager, the one minute manager, teaches a young man how to be an effective manager.

the book teaches common sense management techniques that weren't so common back in the 1980s. when this book was published in 1982, there were no real business books that were written for the average reader. most management books were dry textbooks and there were very few good ones.

if you are a manager, or hope to become one, you should add this book to your reading list. even if management is not in your plans for your future it is a worthwhile read.

in looking at some of the earlier comments on amazon.com, i noticed that some people did not read the parts of the book where it is stated that it doesn't really take only a minute. the idea is to manage effectively without spending a great deal of time doing the same things over and over again.

for those readers who have been to college, think back to which professors actually taught you something.  did you learn the most from the teacher who spoon-fed you the answers that would be on the next test or did you learn from the teacher who caused you to think and come up with your own answers?  for those who believe this is a book that tells managers how to get their underlings to do their work, you  missed the point.

if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.  if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him for life.  in this book the potential one minute manager learns that if you solve your underlings' problems, you help them today.  if you teach an underling how to break their problems down and solve them, you help them solve their problems for life.

for those who feel that the book is simplistic, you need to realize that this is the idea of the book. it is meant to convey a basic management technique in a book that can be read in one sitting. it is not meant to be full of dry research data. it is meant for the average manager to be able to read and still keep up with their busy schedule.

9609,2,"the one minute manager is a parable outlining the fundamental aspects of a ""one minute manager"" program. in the introduction, the authors emphasize the use of the book as a management tool. the key, according to blanchard and johnson, is to learn from the program, applying the principles to daily management functions in an organization, and sharing the newfound wisdom with others.

each section is discussed according to the overarching narrative, followed by a summary emphasizing major concepts. they include ""the first secret: one minute goals,"" ""the second secret: one minute praisings,"" and ""the third secret: one minute reprimands."" mantras relating to these management techniques are peppered throughout the text, displayed as plaques in various offices. these facets are again summarized in the final chapters, reiterating the key points and offering examples regarding the application in actual situations (although the actual situations are ultimately odd and juvenile). the book concludes with encouragement to adopt the ""one minute"" management style immediately, simultaneously sharing the ""gift"" of the program with others in a tone that eerily conjures cult recruitment.

while the book certainly deals with management concepts, its usefulness as a practical tool is limited. written from the point of view of an individual seeking more information on the ideal management style, the narrator is referred to an outstanding manager and seeks to discover the nuances of ""one minute"" management, a concept that seems too good to be true. the narrative is extremely simplistic, frequently relying on examples that are trite and cloying. the character supposedly embodying the ideal manager is usually just irritating, bombastically talking too much without really saying anything at all. while this makes for a fast read that is easily digestible, it undercuts the seriousness of the lessons outlined by the author. these drawbacks are somewhat diminished through the helpful reiterations of key points in the ""one minute"" summaries; serious managers looking for useful strategies without pedestrian fluff would benefit from focusing on these sections exclusively (which are literally encompassed by only four pages). the strategies are not innovative, although the condensed presentation of approaches to goal setting, praise, and reprimand successfully distill this information into extremely manageable parcels that will be easy to implement quickly and effectively. some suggestions are outdated and potentially dangerous, such as recommendations to touch colleagues when offering feedback, but overall the basic suggestions remain relevant.

spencer and blanchard both bring experience as management/human resource consultants for a number of well-known companies. it is clear that as an outgrowth of their consulting work, they have developed the ""one minute manager"" program and the text appears to be the marketing of their trademarked philosophy toward management. the real secret of the ""one minute manager"" is that none of the concepts are actually secrets. they are common, fundamental management principles given a catchy title and framed within a mediocre story. the ideas, while somewhat stale, may be more palatable to inexperienced and broad audiences through the highly anecdotal nature of their delivery.

the one minute manager is ultimately useful for individuals seeking suggestions for basic management strategies in the areas of goal setting and evaluation/feedback. readers seeking in-depth recommendations and management guidance will be disappointed, but those seeking a lighthearted and casual overview of commonly accepted management strategies might appreciate a cute story with a few helpful kernels that outline three fair, honest, and effective management techniques.","quick and easy, but not particularly useful.",1309478400,A3NJOUU2S0TI46,Brittany Turner

el gato con sombrero (el gato en el sombrero)

el sol no brillaba. afuera estaba muy mojado para jugar. as que todo ese da fro nos quedamos en casa, en el mismo lugar.

me sentaba all con sally, nos sentbamos los dos. y dije, quisiera mucho que haya algo que hacer, por dios!

muy mojado para salir y muy fro para jugar con pelotas. as que nos sentbamos en casa, ni siquiera amarrando las botas.

todo lo que podamos hacer fue sentarnos sentarnos, y eso solamente poda molestarnos molestarnos. y eso ni un poquito iba a gustarnos!

en eso escuchamos un pum! ay, nos sobresaltamos an! miramos y lo vimos en la alfombra de cuero. miramos y lo vimos! el gato con sombrero!

y nos dijo, por que estn as si pueden ser fiesteros! yo s que est mojado y el sol no brilla, pero podemos divertirnos durante todo el da!

conozco juegos que podemos jugar, dijo el gato con cara de afiar. yo conozco trucos nuevos enteros, dijo el gato con sombrero.

muchos trucos nuevos que les ensear a los dos - a su madre no le molestar para decirme adis!

entonces sally y yo no sabamos que decir. nuestra madre estaba fuera y no iba a venir.

pero el pez dijo, no! no!  hagan que el gato se vaya! diganle que no quieren jugar, que se vaya a la playa! no debera estar aqu, no debera estar ac, no debera estar cerca mientras su madre no est!

oye, oye, no tengan miedo!, dijo el gato en la alfombra de cuero. mis trucos no son  malos, dijo el gato con sombrero.

s, podemos divertirnos muchsimo  si su deseo lo es, con un juego que llamo arriba arriba con un pez!

bjame! dijo el pez. esto no es divertido, no lo es! bjame! bjame!  dijo el pez. yo no deseo caerme, pues!

no tengas miedo! dijo el gato. no te dejar caer! lo consola. te sostendr arriba mientras me paro en una bola. 

con un libro en una mano! y un vaso en mi sombrero! pero eso no es todo lo que puedo hacer! dijo el gato artero.

 mrenme! mrenme ahora! dijo el gato. con un vaso y una torta encima de mi sombrero! puedo sostener dos libros! puedo sostener el pez un rato! y un barco de jugete! y leche en un plato! y miren! puedo brincar en la bola! pero eso no es todo, dijo mientras se mova la cola. no, no, eso no es todo...

mrenme! mrenme! mrenme ahora! es divertido divertirse pero se debe saber cmo y a qu hora. yo puedo sostener el vaso, y la leche y la torta! puedo sostener estos libros! y el pez en el rastrillo con puntitas cortas. puedo sostener el barco y el hombrecito de juguete! y miren! con mi cola puedo sostener un abanico o siete! puedo abanicar con el abanico mientras brinco en la bola! pero eso no es todo. no, no, eso no es todo...",a rhyming review and my suggestion too,1351728000,A3KFXZVEWIY0U2,Andrea N.

9671,1,"this book is definitely simple, but definitely not profound, timeless or classic.

this is a rather short book -- readable in a single sitting -- and yet it is still mostly fluff. it could easily be condensed to 1/3 of its original length or less without losing any meaning.

my biggest gripe with the book is the format: it is written as a fictional narrative, with a contrived storyline that reads like it was translated from some other language. i really can't stand this style of writing. why introduce these characters at all in a non-fiction book? especially if they aren't based on real-world events, aren't developed at all, and don't serve any allegorical purpose?

i, on the other hand, believe that the word is a very large and complex place. real knowledge can be condensed down to some set of first principles, but over time you only gain understanding by understanding the subtle complexity that underlies everything inside and around us.

the principles in this book are valid -- but almost to the point of obviousness.

1) set goals with your employees (to communicate expectations and set evaluation criteria).
2) reward your employees when they do something right.
3) reprimand your employees when they do something wrong.

sure, this is a jumping off point for some extremely clueless managers, but it also glosses over a lot of subtle complexity involved in motivating people.

to my mind, one of the single most obvious things you can do to motivate people is to flip the question around: ask your employees what motivates *them*. this is going to be different for everybody. money is an important motivator, but some people are also interested in job security; some employees want to be challenged; others want to work on something meaningful, and so on. you really need to understand these various sources of motivation in order to have any hope of keeping them productive.

this book, however, presents a binary view of motivation: either you encourage, or else you reprimand. (i suppose there's a third state suggested, but not explicitly described: not communicating at all.)

as a final nit to pick: for some reason, the unenlightened managers in this book are characterized as having messy offices and calendars that are booked up heavily. the one minute manager, on the other hand, has a perfectly tidy office, and is rarely too busy to take walk-in appointments. this distinction isn't explained in the book at all, but it seems to me to be a subconscious message that one minute managers are also magically transformed into tidy, efficient workers who have a lot of free time to philosophize. indeed, the student in this book evolves into this one minute manager mold and magically his office is cleaned up, too. i'd love to read a ""one minute office organizer"" book. let me know when they write that one.","readers confuse ""simple"" with ""profound""",1231804800,AV5ASI0YCQVN2,Mark H

when this book came out in 1981 it used a new, perhaps fresh, approach to teaching management skills, but since then it has been copied and copied and copied ... when it should be put in a cage. it's time to stop dumbing down and start smartening up books for managers. enough already!

so why was i not impressed with it twenty years later? well, a few reasons. back in the 80's, we bought our books at a place called a book store. there, you could actually thumb through the book before buying it. so, you could easily see that there wasn't much content. the book is 112 pages, but could have easily fit on half that number. ah, the magic of formatting. today, we buy our books online and cannot see that we are dupped into believing there is more content than what is actually here.

also, the basic concept here revolves around 3 simple principles, 1 minute goal setting, 1 minute praising and 1 minute reprimanding. there you have it. don't get me wrong, this is great stuff to know and live by, but by today's standards, this is simply not enough content to warrant the price.

9732,1,"this book started out in similar fashion to the original cat in the hat book, but then it turned ugly and a little disturbing.

once again, the children are left alone, this time responsible for shoveling snow while the mother goes into town. the cat in the hat shows up and invites himself in the house, where he makes himself at home by eating cake in the bathtub.  when he exits the tub, there is a pink ring that needs to be cleaned up.  the cat uses various objects and surfaces in the house to clean the ring, but it eventually winds up outside in the snow.

the cat enlists the help of other cats that are under his hat to ""kill the mess"", using pop guns.  the more the cats shoot, the more the spots spread.  there's an illustration of pink-tinged snow covering the ground, the house, and even a snowman.  this picture, coupled with the words ""kill those spots!  kill the mess!"", just comes across as a little violent and gory to me.

additionally, if the reader has any contact with even the most rote literature, the style of this book will come across remarkably facile and thunderingly dull. i truly cannot believe that this is directed toward anyone with a high school diploma. another reviewer mentions that the book might be read as satire, an idea that i wish i had thought of when i slogged through it. if you see this one sitting on your manager's desk, be sure to toss it in the trash when he isn't looking. the workplace you save might just be your own.",avoid at all costs,1127692800,A2JQGLUWM5OGN2,Brett

the points are laid out clearly and the recommendations simple and easy to implement.  the book can be read quickly in a single sitting or several short pages at a time.  those with very little time can read the four pages that summarize all the points made in the book.

what bothered me about the book was the portrayal of the business world as a very male environment.  a young man looks for the perfect manager and finds the amazing one minute manager, referred to throughout the book as, ""quite a guy!""  the male employees, described by age, explain goal setting and praisings.  the female employees, described with adjectives indicating their dress or competence, are secretaries, those providing general info, or those being reprimanded.  all but one of the acknowledgements are to men as are all but one endorsement.  the authors use sports - golf, football and bowling, as analogies, making for a tone off-putting to female readers.  only on the last page does a young woman come to the formerly young man, now a successful one minute manager, seeking advice.

one minute praising- praise your employees by catching them doing the right thing
one minute reprimand- first reprimand the behavior, second encourage the person (shake hands)

9878,3,"the one minute manager is one of those books that stands even on grocery store shelves, which indicates to me not only that it is a best-seller but also that it is for people with short attention spans who crave repetition. in fact, the one minute manager is one of those books that is easy about which to generalize without even reading it first. you, like me, might be wrong about your pre-conceived notions about it. but it is nearly inevitable to make judgments about the book before reading it. while the content turns out to be more useful and less dismissive than i first feared it might, a book of this style and (considerable lack of) length really lends validation and credibility to a managerial style suited for those without real leadership skills-the brush off, the rude and direct kiss off or needless and personal criticism. sure, when time is limited we may not have the time to be sensitive and to speak deliberately in soft metaphors that cushion the real and blunt intent of our words. however, tact is always appropriate, but this book somehow excuses those who choose to communicate in a non-productive but always critical fashion, even though the book's content by no means condones such tactics. the book's style might lead you to dismiss it as i originally did. it offers quick, keen, simplistic distillations, a mcdonaldization fast food approach, if you will, to dealing with people. never having managed people, i always had the impression that i have been managed by people who absorb the brief and oversimplified ""methods"" espoused here. read the eminent qualifications of the writers (developers of the ""one minute system"") and you will be convinced that they definitely discovered the essence of this fast food managerial style. maybe blanchard and johnson have perfected it, but in true self-help ""hackery"" those who read the book will selectively choose bits and pieces of the philosophy to apply to their own stylistics or, worse yet, will adopt the book's tenets with almost biblical reverence and live all facets of life according to the one minute gospel. this sort of book is theoretically dangerous if misapplied because it very easily and summarily reduces people, problems and communication to one minute. it reeks of shallowness and erases the human face of management (much like boeing executives who recently announced that they will leave seattle. most likely so they will not have to face the employees when the time comes to fire them). strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving. some people who employ these theories fail to remember the very first and overriding principle the book names, ""the one minute manager's symbol-a one minute readout from the face of a modern digital watch-is intended to remind each of us to take a minute out of our day to look into the faces of the people we manage. and to realize that they are our most important resources."" this book encourages managers to discover ""how people produce valuable results and feel good about themselves"", but the ""knowledge"" most people gain from this book in reading it is seldom applied this way. for example, the book emphasizes giving constructive criticism... letting an employee know immediately when s/he has done something good or when s/he has done something wrong and why. a close friend's manager, as an example of a horror story of misapplied principles, read an employee's write-up of something and wrote an expletive in large, red letters across the text of the write-up but failed to provide any insight as to why he wrote that or why he felt it necessary to belittle the work of his employee. he might ask himself the question that the book asks, ""how on earth can i get results if it's not through people? i care about people and results. they go hand in hand."" it is only natural and logical that if you belittle, ridicule, or mistreat your employees, they will not respect you as their manager, will not be as willing to give their best and will certainly be less productive as a result. ""productivity is both quantity and quality."" in the one minute management philosophy there are three simple precepts which the one minute manager establishes with his employees: one minute goal setting, one minute praisings, and one minute reprimands. these are all very logical steps-goal setting makes sure that employees understand perfectly what their duties are, what is expected of them and that there are no surprises. many times in real life managers assume employees know exactly what to do without sitting down with them and concisely defining the goals. (a problem exists if there is a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be happening). sadly, a common description of a misguided manager sounds a lot like managers i have encountered, including those who have read this book. they focus on the negative and do not make their expectations clear. then they ""zap"" the employee at a performance review to make themselves look good or like they are administering discipline, an approach completely full of vanity and professional insecurity. it also leads to unhappy and fearful employees and benefits no one. one minute praising is all about the manager catching the employee doing something right and giving her/him immediate feedback. this is seen as a motivator, with constructive progress reports, focused on the positive. lastly, the one minute reprimands are honest, direct, specific ""what's wrong with what you did and why"" moments. these moments are handled with sensitivity and define only wrong behavior not personal attacks on an individual. the book, my friends, is basically common sense. plain and simple. ""people are not pigeons. people are more complicated. they are aware, they think for themselves, and they certainly don't want to be manipulated by another person. remember that and respect that. it is a key to good management."" this is one statement i can take away from this book, feeling like the 80 or so pages were worthwhile. now if only i could plaster that statement across the foreheads of the bad managers throughout the world.","confucius said ""the essence of knowledge is, have it, use it",999820800,A84UFSF2SZS2W,EriKa

9903,1,"deservedly out of print. the spanish translation does not do justice to the story, being a literal word-by-word translation that destroys the rhythmic, poetic character of seuss's classic. likely to make a child think english is fun, lively language and spanish a dull, pedantic one.",el gato cabizbajo,971136000,A2CWZE3S0H96ES,William Thomas
9907,5,"high drama, thrills, spills, chills...  uh, okay, not really.  but if by some miracle you do not know of this book, perhaps if you have only recently learned english yourself, you really ought to know about it.  it is so worth it.  everyone loves ""the cat in the hat"", it is a  major part of our culture, at least in terms of what culture we expose our  children to.  very funny, very helpful as a beginning reader.","i laughed, i cried",957830400,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,absent_minded_prof
9915,2,"do you have a good critical thought process?  if not, then perhaps you should not read this book.  there are a few decent ideas in it, however, i found a great recommendation from another reader's review:  read dale carnegie and napolean hill for more useful advice, techniques, and thought  processes.  dealing with people is an art, not a science, and needs to be  based upon an honest desire to assist others.  carnegie and hill can help  to develop those ideals.",do you need to read this book?,956102400,A1YIM8MTI305AP,Amazon Customer
9916,1,"what a pathetic and banal depiction  of humanity. it's nice to know that anybody with a pea-brain perspective on management can churn out a bestseller; albeit sad to know that the brainless masses buy into it.
do  yourself a favor and read napoleon hill and carnegie for direction. this  book is horrible.","if you live in the year 2000, ignore this book",949795200,A3OPQGNFAV4CVH,B. Timmins
9917,1,"can anyone learn the complex art of management by reading fairy tales?  probably not, and certainly not from this book.
the book is the glib story of a manager who does almost no work.  he isolates himself from his  employees, forces them to make his decisions for him, and withholds useful  information from them.  on a regular basis, he manipulates their emotions  through pre planned reprimands and praise.
bosses like the one minute  manager exist in real life - the unproductive, poisonous managers who make  everyone's life miserable.  in the story, of course, his employees display  a cult like devotion to the him, and are eager to apply his techniques to  their own hapless subordinates.
the book is not a positive guide for  managers, and is not recommended.",a typical fad management book,949363200,A24MDTPXUMFOTH,Harold B.

9928,5,"when most people become a manager for the first time, they are more than a little unsure of themselves.  naturally, they often use speech and  ways of doing things that they have seen others use.  that's great if their role  models are good, but can be terrible otherwise.
the one minute manager  provides a positive role model for those who have not yet seen one, and  good reinforcement for those who have not seen one lately.
if  organizations try to operate on the assumption that only the manager has  ideas worth acting on, then very little will be accomplished.  the one  minute manager provides a useful model for opening up and stimulating the  minds of everyone in the organization to accomplish more.
not only is  this advice worth following from an effectiveness point of view, it will  also make you feel better about yourself as a manager and as a person when  you follow it.  and you will certainly make those who report to you feel a  lot better, as well.
i like the use of a parable to help each of us  reexamine ourselves, because it makes the reader feel less defensive.  but  be sure to remember what you gut instincts would have been in the same  situations the one minute manager describes.  otherwise, you may miss the  point of how much your behavior needs to change.
this is one of a  handful of books well worth rereading annually.
unlike most business  books, this one is short and easy to read.  the academic language has been  banished, and it is well written.
if you want to go beyond the one  minute manager to get even better results, you will have to learn and use  other beneficial habits as well.  but you can have all the great ideas in  the world, and if you annoy and stifle everyone around you, not much  will  happen.  so think of this book as necessary for more success, but not  sufficient in and of itself for getting the utmost benefits in working with  others.",great role modeling of communications and motivation,945129600,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,Donald Mitchell
